They are a warlike and valiant people who willingly seek out battles as a way of securing personal honor and pride. Any who invade their domains face the fury of their powerful knights and few foes can match them on open ground. The knights range from the youngest Knights Errant, eager to prove their worth, through the Knights of the Realm, defenders of the land. Rarer still are the Questing Knights, wandering warriors engaged in a quest for the Grail. And then there are the legendary Grail Knights themselves, who have succeeded in their quest and sipped from their goddess's Grail, becoming imbued with fey power and longevity.

They are drawn to places where fortunes can be won by ruthless adventures. From the lush jungles of the West to the misty isles of the East, and from the steamy swamplands of the South to the harsh snowlands of the north, the world is truly awash with rag-tag armies of sellswords who nurture the wishful dreams of loot, plunder and adventure. Although many Dogs of War ply their bloody trade to every point on the compass, the most notorious breeding-ground of mercenaries lies within the fraction war-torn city-states of Tilea in the Old World. From all the kingdoms of the Old World and many more beyond, sell-swords come towards Tilea in the tens of thousands, reassured of profitable employment and great battles to be won. Tilea is the battleground from which these gold-hungry mercenaries will ply their expertise to all those willing to pay. Yet no matter the motivation, bold armies of Dogs of War depart every few weeks from the ports of Tilea and sail off into the sunset, ready to conqueror new lands and found new Kingdoms the likes of which no man have ever seen before.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Each Mercenary Company charges its own rates, some straight forward and others are bizarre and unique. These Cost rates are flat and pay for exactly one mercenary&rsquo;s day of service. A full week of service is 3x the listed Cost for the mercenary, however they will not ask for a portion of any loot acquired. Time is money, and these elite mercenaries have no time for simple quick jobs and scuffles, they&rsquo;re above that. If you wish to hire an entire Unit of mercenaries, the Cost will be multiplied by 10x, however they will not share any additional Traits purchased. To make controlling a Unit easier, add the Swarm Creature Trait to the Unit for the purposes of combat. Optional Traits may be purchased for a single mercenary and increase the GC Cost of the mercenary by 50% of their base price per Trait and an increase in their share of the loot by a percentage equal to their Initial Fellowship Bonus prior to any Traits added. Only one mercenary may have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.wGTD2LezlI6Atyy0]{Leader} Trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Availability is relative to the Empire and requires a d100 roll by the GM to see if they may be hired within the territory the PCs occupy. If the PCs wish to hire a company from outside of their territory, they must write a letter with half of the required payment to the designated mercenary company and wait. Their request will take 30 + d10 Days until the PC receives an answer, meanwhile it will take 30 &ndash; Fellowship Bonus Days for the mercenary, or mercenaries, to arrive should they accept any contract with the PC. The Availability of these mercenaries is increased by 2x when in the lands of Araby, Estalia, Marienburg, The Border Princes or Tilea.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.DF6xOfImtDz0shIl]{Empire Veteran Mercenaries}</h3>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 GC + 5d10 Silver Shillings, 15% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> 30% Chance (Does not increase outside The Empire)</p>\n<p><strong>Nation of Origin:</strong> The Empire</p>\n<p><strong>Motto:</strong> None</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.jL0A4uCEWKCbAswW]{Al Muktar&rsquo;s Desert Dogs}</h3>\n<p>Al Muktar's Desert Dogs are a famous band of Dogs of War mercenaries that hail from the arid-deserts of great Araby.

The Leopard Company takes its name from the legendary Leopard of Luccini, which is a badge and mascot of the city. It is said that this Leopard was the guardian of the divine twins Lucan and Luccini, founders of the city. According to the story, the twins became lost in the wilderness &nbsp;when they were still only children and took refuge in a cave carved on a great&nbsp;rock, later to be the acropolis of the city. The cave was the lair of a leopard, but this was no ordinary leopard, she had two heads and three tails! She could also speak prophecies from one of her heads and warnings from the other.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>The Leopard protected the twins just as if they were her own cubs until shepherds found them. They also found the bones of many Orcs, wolves, bears and Trolls around the cave which the leopard had slain protecting the twins. According to the myth, the Leopard prophesied that Lucan and Luccina would found a great city on the rock and rule it as king and queen. Then the other head warned that the descendants of the twins would fight each other for the realm.

The Cult of the Great Prophet started in his home city of Martek, the birthplace of modern Arabyan Civilization, during the time of the prophet Mulhaed al-Quyat&rsquo;s life. He began receiving what Arabyans regard as divine revelations delivered through the god Ormazd. Afterwards he was said to have spawned the oasis&rsquo; across Araby, granting fertile land and precious water to the people. Since the &ldquo;War of the Death&rdquo; and the destruction of Bel-Aliad at the hands of Arkhan the Black more than a thousand years prior, Araby had been a broken nation, but Mulhaed al-Quyat reunited the peoples of Araby, and through faith became the first Great Sultan. Today, despite Araby&rsquo;s decline after the Crusades in the 15th Century IC, the faith is held strongly. However, it is theorized by imperial scholars that the entity the Great Prophet received visions from was an even older god, perhaps one that was worshipped by another now long-lost civilization.</p>\n<p>His holy symbol is that of a crescent moon, and it can be seen on many Arabyan standards, and even the shape of their shield; something that his worshippers believe will bless them in battle.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ormazd's Blessings and Strictures :</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0798%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Battle}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Courage}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.52846%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.maUl7MoLvuvTOhM0]{Grace}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.6365%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Protection}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.815%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Tenacity}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FRkIz2sR7ZC92W2G]{Wisdom}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>There are no gods equal to Ormazd.</li>\n<li>Pray facing Martek three times each day to Ormazd: at dawn, two hours past midday, and two hours past sunset.</li>\n<li>Donate a fixed portion of your income to believers in need.

The Kingdoms of Ind is also widely known as the Land of a Thousand Gods, and for good reason. The piety on display&mdash;from the temples of marble that reach the sky to the innumerable symbols found in every household, piece of clothing and jewelry&mdash;is enough to raise an eyebrow from all but the most dogmatic of the Sigmarite, Myrmidian and Ulrician faiths. The Indan religion is one of polytheism, worshipping not one but numerous gods (or &lsquo;Devas&rsquo; as the people of Ind call them) at once, each representing a different aspect of the religion&rsquo;s teachings. While the idea of practicing the faith of multiple gods isn&rsquo;t new, it&rsquo;s the equal worship of the Divine Trinity (Brahmir, Vaishna and Shaivi) and their children that makes them unique. Unlike the Empire that squabbles between its own faiths--such as the Cult of Sigmar and Ulric--the people of Ind worship under a unified pantheon. Some gods fall into greater favor than others, but it is extremely rare to find sects dedicated to only one or a few gods and excluding the rest of the pantheon.</p>\n<p>Priests of the Divine Trinity can be found wearing long, colorful robes with markings on their foreheads.

They are clad in armor and wear massive turbans called dastaar which are covered in religious symbols of the various gods and are said to grow larger as the war priest gains experience.

If they complete the career and move on or abandon it to take up a different basic career, the effects of the Talent lapse. If the character completes the career and becomes a @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.cAwJfiBBQvnftP8F]{Grail Knight}, the Talent is lost altogether. If they simply abandoned the Quest, they retain the Talent receiving endless visions, and if the knight re-enters the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} career its effects apply once more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Becoming a Grail Knight</h2>\n<p><strong>The Grail Quest:</strong> The @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight's} quest is a defining feature of the how the character plays each session, both mechanically and during roleplaying. It must provide a sufficient challenge in order for the knight to logically complete the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} career and to enter the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.cAwJfiBBQvnftP8F]{Grail Knight} career, and the adventures included should have more significance than the defeat of random fringe bands of bandits, greenskins or a monster. Once the character has reached the point of advancement from @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} to @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.cAwJfiBBQvnftP8F]{Grail Knight}, they should be put under one last significant task by The Lady, usually consisting of 3-5 or more sessions of story content leading to their final encounter with The Green Knight.</p>\n<p><strong>Significance : </strong>There are many different types of significance which suit different styles of play. In one example, the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} could unearth and defeat a significant threat to the land of Bretonnia be it internal or outside its borders:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>For example: </strong>This might be a secretive underground Chaos or Necromancy cult hiding in a major city or large town, an Orc warlord ravaging the local populace--possibly the beginning of an Orc WAAAGH!!!, a Bestigor gathering a war herd, or even a Norscan raiding party being led by a potential Chosen of the Chaos Gods unleashing carnage in their names.</p>\n<p>Another method could have the events of the quest force the Questing Knight to face their weaknesses or past mistakes. Thus, a knight who failed to defend a village against an Orc attack might find themselves placed to defend a different village from a horde of Beastmen. On the other hand, a knight with a tendency to lose their temper might find themselves forced to calmly negotiate peace between two nobles or warring factions who hate each other and have nothing but contempt for the Questing Knight and their companions.</p>\n<p>Whilst other player characters may be involved, they are essentially following the knight on their quest. If the Questing Knight is uncovering a major threat to the land, then it&rsquo;s the sort of thing adventurers do anyway. If they&rsquo;re facing their own flaws, the other characters may feel a bit left out, so considering bridging the knight&rsquo;s personal journey with one or more of their companions. Perhaps the knight failed to protect one of them in a past encounter causing them to lose an eye or an arm, or gain a Corruption Point? The best thing to do here is talk to the players and see what they would be happiest doing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Green Knight</h2>\n<p>The final part of the quest, the confrontation with the Green Knight, is for the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} alone. The combat with the Green Knight could be a purely symbolic gesture if the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} has saved Bretonnia from a major threat, or it could be a test of whether or not the knight has the skill to back up their acts of chivalry. At this point it is up to the GM how to proceed. The Green Knight is one of, if not the most skilled duelist in Warhammer Fantasy, besting innumerable foes and being virtually immortal; however, his stats don&rsquo;t need to reflect this fact. The Green Knight is a test, just like any of the tests sent by The Lady to her loyal knights during the rest of their Quest. It is recommended, if you stat the Green Knight, that he acts as a counter to the knight PC, with his Characteristics, Trappings and Talents being nearly identical. Once the duel is finished (preferably in victory) the final step with the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.cAwJfiBBQvnftP8F]{Grail Knight} is all that remains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Lady of the Lake</h2>\n<p>The meeting with the Lady is a dramatic event. Lights shine from the lake that you meet her by. The Lady, dazzlingly beautiful, walks across water and through the mists holding the Grail for the knight to drink, and as the character drinks from the Grail they see the whole world in a new divine way. The @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} hears the stories of the encounters between the greatest of Bretonnia&rsquo;s heroes, including the Grail Companions, and the Green Knight and the Lady. Their encounters include elements from the stories made from the experiences of the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.ajuoEMh4XZ5SFSyI]{Questing Knight} and the party they accompany, making it clear that the knight&rsquo;s journey and friendship is just as much a part of the same tradition since Bretonnia&rsquo;s unification. After this ceremony is concluded, the PC may select a Grail Virtue, assuming they have purchased at least one Knightly Virtue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Grail Virtues</strong></h3>\n<p>You may select one Grail Virtue after advancing to @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.careers-nom.cAwJfiBBQvnftP8F]{Grail Knight}. This virtue cannot be retracted or upgraded and requires you&rsquo;ve acquired the Knightly Virtue of the same name: You cannot acquire the Grail Virtue of Audacity for instance without first acquiring the Knightly Virtue of Audacity.

The Lore of the Desert is considered a difficult Wind to perceive and manipulate, appearing scattered even to those skilled with the Sight, resembling a chaotic sandstorm as it swirls around them. This makes it tricky to manipulate but dangerous in the hands of a skilled Magician. The wind is associated with power, intelligence, and prestige. The Magicians of Araby are acclaimed for their skill, knowledge, and their sheer determination, even able to bend the wills of the Djinn, magical being of the elements, to their service. Spells from the Lore of the desert are some of the most bizarre, including summoning desert sands even in areas of the world where it impossible, and those that summon Djinn to the mortal plane. There are also more manipulative applications used to fool enemies by summoning mirror images of their deepest desires, such as piles of gold, or even copies of yourself making it impossible for them to confront you. Magicians of the Lore of the Desert tend to wear fine silk robes known as &ldquo;thawbs&rdquo; in Araby accompanied by a traditional headwrap known as a &ldquo;keffiyeh&rdquo;. Due to their higher status within the Arabyan hierarchy, Magicians rarely dress the same--dying their robes in exotic colors and having them designed with eccentric and unique patterns that reflect their personality, favoring fashion over practicality. Those with the money to do so flaunt their wealth with glittering jewelry hanging from their necks, and fine bangles and rings across their arms and fingers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Lore Attribute:</strong>&nbsp;Arcane Spells summoned from the Lore of the Desert tend to summon or shift large amounts of dust and sands upon their targets or shroud the caster in whirling sands like a desert storm. Whenever a spell from the Lore of the Desert is cast upon a target, that target has their Movement reduced by -1 and cannot Charge for the duration of the round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>&nbsp;Magicians of the Lore of the Desert use many artefacts associated with the harsh arid lands of Araby, supplemented by crystals, glass jars, gemstones, lamps and small statues depicting the mystical beings known as Djinn.

Dazh is often comparable to Shallya in terms of benevolence and caring for his followers, and this attitude reflects strongly on the priests who worship him. Priests of Dazh are warm-hearted individuals who take deep pride in their hearts and homes, and many bedeck themselves in sacred gold.

The Axe of Tor is a sacred symbol among the people of Kislev, as his influence is so powerful that even towns sacked by marauders are said to have their temples dedicated to Tor perfectly intact. It is theorized that even the foul servants of Chaos dare not tempt his wrath, for his reputation as a butcher of daemons and undead is so legendary, and his followers so full of vengeful fury, that it&rsquo;s a guaranteed death sentence to anger the ancient war god. Priests of Tor are often taciturn and belligerent, and many wield war axes detailed in sacred silver. Those who call upon Tor can be quick to anger, and many are drawn to high locations, such as mountains or tall towers. At the GM&rsquo;s whim, any use of Torinyi prayers involving thunder, lightning, or rain may bring on a full storm.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tor's Blessings and Strictures :</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0798%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Battle}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Courage}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.37318%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Hardiness}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.7918%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.KSDrXcieyRc37YI7]{Might}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.815%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Savagery}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Tenacity}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Never stand under a tree during a thunderstorm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Miracles of Tor</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.prayers-nom.Kj16kz7MhUyglfWj]{Call of Tor}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.prayers-nom.B8XYBARBek7wsdfa]{Cleave the Sky}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.prayers-nom.eraiMWviMkD0rOWs]{Do Tor!}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.prayers-nom.EgrP2ecMVHjOJXWu]{Incoming Storm}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.prayers-nom.AVuXwKD8JpdWHZVA]{Thunder of War}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.prayers-nom.LhrVlXwDApp0Zhcg]{Tor's Fury}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.prayers-nom.ZYMpqR54q3J4V4Bv]{Wrath of Tor}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ursun, God of Bears and Strength</h2>\n<p>Ursun is the God of bears and patron of Kislev. His cult was introduced by the Gospodars almost a thousand years ago and is now the most powerful in the land. Priests of Ursun tend to be wild individuals, and many wear sacred skins and holy bear bones. The trails to becoming a priest of Ursun are brutal, with the most famous requiring an acolyte to wrestle a bear in the woods bare handed. Those calling upon Ursun are often uncomfortable around the trappings of civilization and frequently grow lethargic in winter. It is very common for Ursun priests, especially war priests, to travel into the same forests in which they first underwent the test to becoming a priest, reacquainting with the bear they wrestled with, and through various means, bond with them making the bear a valued ally, mount and friend.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ursun's Blessings and Strictures :</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0798%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Battle}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Courage}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.37318%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Hardiness}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.7918%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.By5dc8Q7ZAGpr177]{The Hunt}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.815%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.KSDrXcieyRc37YI7]{Might}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.66%; text-align: center;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Righteousness}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Never hunt a bear in winter&mdash;let him sleep as he lets you sleep.</li>\n<li>Wake the bear in the spring, and feed him well before his winter rests.</li>\n<li>Bears must only be killed by the strength of your hand or the flight of an arrow.</li>\n<li>Only display the hide, claw, tooth, or skull of a bear you have killed yourself.</li>\n<li>Shun the comforts of indoor life whenever possible.

Before invading Kislev in 1497 IC under the Khan-Queen Miska, the first Ice Witches practiced their magic on the Endless Steppe. Unlike their former brethren, the Hung and Kurgan&mdash;who worshipped the Great Eye after falling to Chaos&mdash;the Gospodars learned to tap the cold power coursing through the land itself, establishing a relationship not too dissimilar with the Jade Order and their ties to nature. The ice witches of Kislev are more than just women with the ability to channel the Ancient Widow&rsquo;s cold flows; they are an organized sisterhood who works together to achieve shared goals under the orders of the Tzar/Tzarina of Kislev. Although this magic does not carry the same risks of mutation as magics of Chaos, it is very difficult to control and often kills unwary and inexperienced Witches. Many centuries later, things are little different. As should be expected for a magic with its roots in wars on the Endless Steppe, Ice Magic is deadly and extremely so, not just for the Witches&rsquo; enemies but for the Witches themselves. Many apprentice Witches do not survive their training; indeed, some can be found to this day in isolated corners of the Oblast, frozen eternally as sparkling statues of ice by the magic they failed to control. Ice witches can often be found wearing heavy winters clothes with fur coats, capes and boots (even in hotter climates) with older and more experienced ice witches wearing crowns of ice on their heads.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Lore Attribute:</strong> The flows of Ice Magic vary in strength. By Kislev&rsquo;s sites of power, along her leylines, in freezing climates and in the depths of winter, Ice Magic is very strong, granting you a +10 to all Channeling and Language Magick Tests when casting the Lore of Ice. But in warmer climes, it is far weaker and wanes the closer to the equator and the further from the North one travels. When casting in warmer climates, such as in most of the Empire, it counts as if casting next to a Corrupting Influence, causing a Minor Miscast on a unit&rsquo;s roll of an 8. If you already have a Minor Miscast, the Miscast becomes a Major Miscast. In hotter climates, such as in a desert or jungle, you receive a permanent Fatigued Condition until you relocate to a cooler climate. You may spend a Resolve point to mitigate this Fatigue Condition for one round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Ice of all types, from snowflakes, hailstones, icicles and carved ice sculptures, comprise the majority of the Lore of Ice&rsquo;s ingredients. While plentiful in the cold lands of Kislev, due to their frozen nature, it is potentially much more difficult to acquire or preserve these ingredients needed depending on the region, climate and time of year. However, many spells also use trappings associated with the body parts of certain wildlife within Kislev, including the claws of a frostfiend, a ball of bear fat, fangs of a white dragon or the tongue of a hawk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Spells:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.qgdwGhYIaGYWR6h9]{Biting Wind}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.pOql6YVNBt21t13s]{Blizzard}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.mqktfTIQDkgycvwc]{Chill}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.qu4My8KV2Wq9LPRM]{Chill Voice}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.c0DM4WCtLftKxDPd]{Crystal Cloak}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.8xcqDJycW7O9OOP4]{Death Frost}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.sSMen3XXCY2jZ2CV]{Form of the Frostfiend}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.mqkBtPUX7NEF0ouV]{Frost Blade}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.UXHgHKjAUAa27zfc]{Hailstorm}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.c2kGYd5oOCO9XqVR]{Hawks of Miska}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.2DO6nDvYhzI9ajKg]{Ice Maiden's Kiss}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.HL4p2CRTTshAczbK]{Ice Sheet}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.4IxkhraDM0cYmEr7]{Permafrost}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.nlG5zkUTh1uNTSu2]{Shardstorm}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.Tcgfdb7iVdo6Dc8i]{Shoika's Call}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.vMb9P8WdJRebN93m]{Walk the Endless Steppe}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.9GeKCw8XW2zRcb4L]{Wall of Ice}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.spells-nom.qCuzgwOb45ybYZaQ]{Winter Walk}</li>\n</ul>"}

Averland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The people of Averland are curious folk. Folk whisper the proud bloodline of the Brigundians has somewhat curdled with time, inbreeding, and the looming influence of the Black Mountains. At their best, Averlanders are open, passionate, and honest about just what they're thinking. If a funeral happens to strike them as funny, well, they'll laugh. If someone upsets them, they'll let you know. Known to be generous, especially when entertaining, Averlanders prize those skilled at the art of telling tall stories, something wandering entertainers are very glad of. Dwarfs are also very welcomed in Averland as their plain talking ways are much admired.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>At their worst Averlanders are contradictory, flighty, and changeable. Astrology and other such superstitions are very popular in Averland, and merchants will often ditch a deal made in \"an unfavoruable hour\" or on an \"unlucky day.\" Marius Leitdorf, known for his dark depression and strange rages, was considered typical of the Averland temperment. Even Trollslayers have been heard to say that Averlanders are \"a bit odd in the head.\" Their changeable nature has resulted in many jokes about regiments of Averlanders retreating in the face of fear, something that irritates them to no end. They resent any implication that their martial prowess is any less than that of any other states. Averlanders are also known for their intolerance of lawyers and contracts, as they imply a man might change his mind. Those dealing with Averlanders are constantly irritated with their insistence that everything be done \"on honour\" - particularly given their unreliable reputation.

At their best, Hochlanders are loyal, valiant, and adaptable. <sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Present-day Hochlanders are amongst the most open minded and friendly people in the Empire. With their lands being a crossroad for so much of the northern and eastern Empire, they have developed tolerance that is considered unusual everywhere else in the realm.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Though mainly worshippers of Taal, Rhya, and of Sigmar, contact with travellers and merchants using the roads has made Ulric popular in the northeast, while Shallya also has a strong cult.

Fond of hunting in all its form, tales of loyal friendship and jaunty ballads, Hochlanders are also known to be easily distracted by the prospect of little sport.Some folk of other Imperial provinces also whisper that the Hochlanders' valiant nature is due more to their naivety than any innate loyalty.

Middenland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like all Northerners, Middenlanders are famed for their stubborn ways. This, their Teutogen blood and their &ldquo;firebrand&rdquo; tempers has given them a reputation as uncontrollable traditionalists. They hate change of all types, and defend what they see as &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; at all cost. They are the last to admit that they are wrong, and the first to challenge an unworthy leader. Whilst those of southern Middenland are less strident than their Drakwald cousins, even they are considered coarse, arrogant, and controlling by the rest of the Empire. At their best, Middenlanders are staunch defenders of pride, property and traditions. Should an unjust tax be levied, Middenlanders will march in protest, torches flaming and pitchforks raised. They can sometimes rally behind a single person&rsquo;s case, particularly those of destitute war widows, orphans and put upon guild members.</p>\n<p>This has caused Middenland politics to have a crude, rabble-rousing element that does not exist so much in other provinces. At their worst, Middenlanders are a fractious, intolerant group of individuals. Not only are they quick to mock those they see as foppish, dandified folk, they are also exceedingly suspicious of foreign influence upon their province. They refuse to use the occasional Bretonnian, Tilean, or Estalian words that have been absorbed into Reikspiel. Ordering a Bretonnian brandy in a Middenland Tavern will cause a yawning silence as all the folk look round at the fool who has just signed his own death warrant.</p>\n<p>Middenlanders are divided along what were once boundaries of ancient Teutogen Clans, but have now been divided into geographical prejudices. At one time the Drakwald region had a distinct identity from the rest of Middenland, producing a line of notoriously corrupt Emperors. With the collapse of their dynasty and the devastation of the Great Plague of 1111, the power of the Drakwald was decimated. It ceased to exist as a separate entity when the Emperor Mandred gave it to Middenheim, creating the province as it stands today. Its people are still known as mean-spirited and grasping but seem to be softening over time and incorporated into the Middenlander people.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rules for creating a Middenlander or a Middenheimer character are described page 151 &amp; 152 of the official Supplement <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"nordland\">4. Nordland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The people of Nordland are descendents of the ancient <em>Was Jutone</em> tribe. Close brothers to the Udoses and Was Jutones tribe of Ostland, the Nordland branch of the tribe eventually became estranged from the more easterly settlements of their peoples. Eventually the early Nordlanders fell in battle, becoming vassals of the belligerent Teutogens, and frequent victims of Norscan raids. During the chaos that reigned in the aftermath of the Great Plague, much of Nordland's coast was invaded and colonised by the Norscans, leading to a mingling of the tribal bloodlines. Emperor Mandred Ratslayer, faced with graver threats elsewhere, had little time to answer the pleas of the Nordlanders, much to their horror.</p>\n<p>As time passed and populations mixed, the Nordlanders adopted many of the customs of their Norscan cousins. Courts frequently resort to trial of combat, the contest taking place on a white sheet pegged to the ground. The first person to stain the sheet red with his blood is declared the loser and the guilty party. Older houses often have runes carved into their doors and window frames for luck and spiritual protection, and along the coast the longhouse style is still common. At feasts and gatherings, Norscan bragging contests have evolved into more genteel storytelling events, with each speaker trying to outdo the last.</p>\n<p>So great is the Nordlanders love of stories that they have become famous around the Empire as great storytellers. The folk of this province are said to be amongst the loudest and frankest of all the empire. They seem to lack any subtlety, tact, or common sense. Several local legends involve heroes who blurt out the truth at the vital moments, thus saving the day. Other provinces point out this is because Nordlanders are too stupid to lie. At their best Nordlanders are solid, straightforward, and honest folk, looking down upon (while lacking the guile of) the mealy mouthed words of politicians, poets, and soft Reiklanders.</p>\n<p>At their worst, Nordlanders are churlish, uncouth, thoughtless speakers. Even the merchants of Nordland have this blunt approach, though they seem to be fine with double-dealings. Indeed they have found that shouting the final price has a profound effect upon merchants used to the subtleties of barter and negotiation. Many provinces point out that this is because of their mongrel <em>Was Jutone</em>, <em>Teutogen</em>, and <em>Norscan </em>Bloodlines. This mixed of heritage has been a source of Nordlander shame for many generations. Modern Imperials look on Norscans with a mixture of admiration and fear, seeing them both as powerful warriors and wild, uncivilized barbarians, not to be trusted around one's daughters or sheep. A popular Imperial saying runs \"<em>Character is in the blood</em>\", meaning the ancestry determines character.</p>\n<p>Thus the Nordlanders are often regarded as \"Not quite like us\" rougher and more uncouth even more so than the wild and hairy Middenlanders. Another case of discomfort among Nordlanders comes form their current fashion among nobles especially in the north, for tracing ancestry back to one of the founding tribes. The purer the background the higher ones status climbs, and the summit is the tracing of a lineage back to one of the founding chiefs. Alone amongst the provinces, the Nordlanders ancestors were conquered by outsiders, which is a source of embarrassment for status-conscious nobles, particularly when dealing with arrogant Middenlanders and Stirlander bumkpins.</p>\n<p>To compensate, most Nordlanders are more vocally and demonstratively loyal to the Empire and the Cult of Ulric than almost anyone else in the empire. Their efforts ring hollow to some, while others see them as examples of duty and patriotism. Whatever the motive, there is no doubting their bravery in battle. When in an army with troops from other provinces, Nordlanders are rash in their desire to close with the enemy. At the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Battle of Frote (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQmF0dGxlX29mX0Zyb3RlP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\">Battle of Frote</a> in 2421 IC, the Nordland pikes were so anxious to come to grips with the forces of Chaos that they charged before an order was given, leaving them isolated on the battlefield and their own army's flank exposed. Since then imperial generals have been quietly advised to treat the Nordlanders \"as they would a hound on a leash\" - to keep them under control.</p>\n<p>Renowned hunters and foresters, the Nordlanders woodland skills are so strong that even Hochlanders and the folk of the Talabec will grudgingly admit that they are \"not too bad\". Certainly Nordlanders are close to the land: the province has one of the largest communites of Rhya worship in the North of the Empire centred around the clannish villages south of Hargendorf. The Worship of the Harvest Mother without her consort Taal, is considered particularly dangerous in some circles of thought. Talabeclanders in particular are dismissive of this \"women worship\". They whisper that the Elves join the Humans for their religious rites at old stone circles deep in the woods, though speculation is rife, so no-one knows what really goes on in these ceremonies. The Elector Count is not comfortable with this, and is considering sending investigators to determine if the people of the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Demst Vale (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRGVtc3RfVmFsZT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Demst Vale</a> are planning a revolt. A Nordlander's accent is one of the most distinctive of the Empire. Their speech is very harsh and fast, almost barked out rather then spoken.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rules for creating a Nordlander character are described page 153 of the official Supplement <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"ostermark\">5. Ostermark</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ostermarkers tend to be stout and thickset, and their eyes often reveal an Eastern heritage brought by the Ungols long ago. Their men are given to wearing long, thick moustaches rather than beards, and a high-peaked fur hat replaces the more fashionable floppy headgear found elsewhere in the Empire. Women wear their hair loose if single, or in a long braid wound up at the back of the head if married. Because of the cold weather, Ostermarkers tend to wear several layers of clothing in a style that seems quaint or old-fashioned to others in the Empire.&nbsp;At their best, Ostermarkers are vibrant souls, with a love of life, horses, vodka, and dancing. Their women in particular are known for their quick tempers and passionate nature. More than one Reiklander dandy has been dumped semi-naked on the Veldt after attempting to seduce a maid of Ostermark &mdash; often by the maid herself.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Few Empire folk naturally think of this side of the Ostermark nature, however. Most claim that Ostermarkers are half Kislevite, half peasant and entirely morose. Famed for long drinking binges, elaborate funerals, and combinations of the two, many people fear to ask an Ostermarker how their day has been, for fear of a depressing monologue.&nbsp;At their worst Ostermarkers show an almost theatrical obsession with death and its trappings. Women seldom remarry once widowed, for no Ostermark husband would stay in Morr&rsquo;s realm knowing another man was with his wife.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Fear of hauntings makes exorcists and priests of Morr very welcome throughout Ostermark, whilst carpenters are very much in demand to carve the elaborate coffins that are so common in this province. To an Ostermarker, this tradition of flamboyant despair is natural. Coming from a province that is regularly raided, destroyed, and plundered, they understand that death is a common part of life.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup>&nbsp; <strong>- Warhammer Forum</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.R2ytluHiEFF2KQ5e]{Consume Alcohol}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.I0yPc4PH5erWJLmu]{Intimidate}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.cYtU0ORRFCOpQLWz]{Intuition}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.EXysjCwmGzCOiRDx]{Language (Gospodarinyi)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Ungol)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Ostermark)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.PzimjNx9Ojq4g6mV]{Melee (Polearm)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQSm2AwrgT2cHG0C]{Ranged (Bow)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>One&nbsp;@Table[talents], @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.5lcttqGToT54WFrl]{Marksman}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.JLzJws09GMw9GWBV]{Coolheaded}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"ostland\">6.

Said to be capable of eating anything, there are several mocking songs about the famous &lsquo;Stone soup of Ostland&rsquo; They are so creative in their frugality that a common joke in the Empire claims that Ostlanders make &lsquo;stone soup&rsquo; with only one stone, for fear of wasting good rocks. While an exaggeration, it is true that Ostlanders are skilled in getting the most use out of what they have to work with and for being loath to throw anything away that might still be useful. This conservatism has at times cost them, as when <a class=\"new\" title=\"Von Raukov (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVm9uX1JhdWtvdj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">von Raukov&rsquo;s</a> predecessors refused to adopt gunpowder weapons, because that would mean wasting perfectly good swords and spears.

They hate waste of all sorts, as well as &ldquo;needless ostentation.&rdquo; A strong streak of jealousy against the so-called &ldquo;breadbasket&rdquo; provinces of Reikland, Stirland, Averland, and the Moot rises up in drunken rages. More than ever, stout soldiers are toasting old glories with Kislev Vodka, sinking into drunken stupors or violent rampages. Short shrift is also given to those who complain of hardship.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Ostlanders, like most Imperials, honour all the gods and celebrate their feast days. If one god is favoured over another, however, it is Sigmar, who is worshipped with a degree of devotion not often seen north of the Empire. Surrounded by lands that lean toward Ulric, Taal and Rhya, few know why this is so, though many offer explanations. Devout Ostlanders say it stems from the time when, soon after the founding of the Empire, a great dragon ravaged Ostland. The other electors and their armies were afraid to face the beast, so Sigmar came alone and killed it after a great fight alongside the Ostland Count.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, cynics suggest that Ostlanders are so devoted because their &ldquo;poor cousin&rdquo; Electors have to keep borrowing money from wealthy Reiklanders and thus need to keep them happy. Whatever the truth, it is a fact that even the smallest Ostlander village sports multiple shrines to Sigmar. Ostlanders are known for the strange pacing and Kislevite tones of their speech.

Reikland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Reiklanders are the descendants of the fierce Unberogens, a warrior tribe of the northern Old World which saw the lands unified under their king Sigmar during the founding years of the Empire. At their best, Reiklanders are friendly, sociable, and open-minded, more so than the rest of the Empire.</p>\n<p>Reiklanders are optimists who believe that the best is yet to come. They point out several reasons for this: the natural bounty of their lands, an educated and energetic populace, and the fact that Sigmar was one of them. How could the future be dim for a land and people that once gave birth to a god? Reiklanders have adopted Sigmar's message of Imperial unity wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p>Reiklanders take a keen interest in the affairs of the other Imperial provinces, and often point out that \"something should be done\" when terrible fates befall their neighbours. Robust supporters of the Imperial military, many young Reikland nobles enter the army to make their name and fortune. Considered natural \"officer material\" the chances of advancement are considerably better for those of Reiklander birth, much to others' disapproval.</p>\n<p>Reiklanders almost always answer an Imperial call-to-arms in large numbers, and feel as if its their duty to come to the aid of less fortunate parts of the Empire. Indeed, among some Reiklanders the ideal of expansion is as strong as it was in the early days of the Empire: Agitators in Ubersreik and Altdorf press for war with Bretonnia to reclaim the \"West March.\"</p>\n<p>Merchants' guilds desire to see the Emperor strengthen his position against the Elector Counts, and thereby call for unitary trade laws, which would be overseen by Imperial officials, something the Electors fiercely resist, determined to see no further centralisation of Imperial political power.</p>\n<p>Fashion plays a more important role in a Reiklander's social life than in most other provinces. The peasantry, of course, care little for such fripperies, but amongst the growing middle classes the correct sleeves, shoes, and colours are matters of great import. The Reiklander nobility tend to set the fashion for a season, leaving it to the merchant and other \"grubby tradesmen\" to copy their new styles as fast as they can.</p>\n<p>The presence of the Imperial Court in Altdorf has only served to exacerbate these tendencies. Recent vogues have included Bretonnian styles, the \"new rustic,\" and most recently a return to simple militaristic clothing reminiscent of an earlier era. Slashed sleeves, elaborate codpieces, and reliquary charms remain as fashionable as ever.</p>\n<p>At their worst, Reiklanders are arrogant, overbearing, and drunken slaves to fashion. Notorious for their ability to celebrate at the drop of a hat, the image of the beribboned Reiklander sot is a popular stereotype amongst the rest of the Empire. In certain places the small black insects that plague an ill-kept taproom are known as \"Reikflies\" as they can detect the smallest amount of ale unerringly.</p>\n<p>The people of many of the other Imperial provinces are suspicious of the fashionable, cosmopolitan nature of the Reikland men, claiming that they are effeminate and womanish for caring so much about what they wear. Curiously, Reiklander men also have a reputation as wife-stealing, pig-buggering philanderers.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>More than one Talabeclander husband has found his woman seduced by the charming words and dashing look of a Reiklander dandy. Reiklander women, meanwhile, are known for their beauty, as well as unbearably vain personality.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Loud, outspoken, and often smug about the imagined superiority of their opinions, Reiklanders are traditionally known to be controlling and strongly opinionated. Their lack of stamina is also a welcome source for vituperative and malicious comments amongst the other peoples of the Empire. <sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup><strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reiklander Characters use the default Human Creation rules from the <a title=\"WFRP4e Core Module\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e-core/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WFRP4e Core Module</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"stirland\">8. Stirland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For their part, the folk of Stirland are proud of their preservation of ancient customs, and of their &ldquo;long view&rdquo; of life. At their best, Stirlanders are calm, thoughtful, and practised at taking their time about things. Fond of long, ribald tales, the local tavern is the heart of any Stirlander community. Here people gather to hear their favourite stories, the local gossip, and occasionally news from the outside world. Racing is also a firm favourite of the Stirland people&mdash;though not the traditional foot or horseback racing liked by the rest of the Empire.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>As most communities are based about arable farmlands, geese, cows, pigs, and ratting dogs are frequently raced against one another in local competitions. Usually held on a festival or market day, the winning beast is often awarded &ldquo;ribbons and reprieve,&rdquo; meaning it will never be destined for the table. At their worst, Stirlanders are isolationist, suspicious, and highly conservative. Stirlanders, however, see themselves as simply keeping traditions: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve worked in the past, so no sense in changing now,&rdquo; as Stirlanders like to say. They find it hard to make friends&mdash;often taking years to accept newcomers within their communities. Most of the Empire regards them as savages, simply for their custom of drinking hot ale.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>There are many other odd customs; for example, when strangers approach a village in the Stirh&uuml;gels, children will throw pig droppings at them in the belief that this will drive away evil spirits. They believe that a person hit with tossed pig excrement is especially protected. In the villages near Sylvania, houses and windows are lined with an especially pungent strain of local garlic to ward of what are euphemistically called &ldquo;the Count&rsquo;s Men.&rdquo; When someone vanishes, locals swear that the fault lies with old garlic, not that the folk belief itself is wrong. Stirlanders within the central territories of the province are known for their dislike of Halflings, for they still resent the 1500-year-old decision that tore away their best farmlands and gave them to &ldquo;the Shorties.&rdquo; Although this resentment rarely breaks out in violence, the belief that Halflings are thieves at heart is stronger here than in any other part of the Empire.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Forum</strong><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.d3VZwO4Y5JH5DXdT]{Bribery}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.bSWoV1IiS5qWNw39]{Evaluate}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Cg2b92BRjvxYXZiE]{Language (Mootish)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Stirland)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQSm2AwrgT2cHG0C]{Ranged (Bow)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rvd0S8Z0v2m0MHmD]{Sleight of Hand}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Xk5tp3aasPNtk4zt]{Stealth (Rural)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.zkI6tIqbyAZvh0Th]{Stealth (Urban)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>One&nbsp;@Table[talents], @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.7bZjB82f6LSkeczP]{Nimble Fingered}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"sylvania\">9. Sylvania</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sylvanians often have a blas&eacute; attitude towards death and the dead that is at odds with their neighbours. They take a perverse pride in the harshness of their life, seeing others as &ldquo;soft&rdquo; for living in warmer climes, using blackpowder weapons, or associating with the other races. Sylvanians believe in the worst stereotypes, and it is common to find they believe Dwarfs drown cats, and Halflings routinely eat each other. This attitude goes all the way back to the Fennones of old, who refused to deal with the Dwarfs they encountered in the foothills of the Worlds Edge Mountains because they ignorantly believed that they came from the same place as the marauding Greenskins who raided their land.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>The largest towns of Sylvania are still considered rural backwaters by the standards of cultured Empire folk, half-empty places where everybody wears codpieces that haven't been fashionable for over fifty years. These towns support only a few burghers, as few can afford their bills, and most are merely overgrown villages that happen to be built on better land. Since Sylvania&rsquo;s population never truly recovered from the Black Plague and the contagions that followed, overcrowding had never been a problem.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>In addition to disease, mutation is rife amongst the peasants. The thin soil has been riddled with Warpstone since 1111 IC, giving Sylvania one of the highest rates of mutation in the Empire. The most deformed Mutants are cast out into the woods or sent to Drakenhof, but many who would be burned elsewhere are accepted in Sylvania. Hunchbacks, walleyes, and those with additional digits are treated no differently from others.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>With the low yield of crops, starvation is a constant threat, and most accept hunger pains as a normal part of life. Turning to &ldquo;sweet pork&rdquo;, the Sylvanians&rsquo; euphemism for Human flesh, is considered distasteful but not evil. Desperate times can call for desperate measures, and the Ghouls that raid the villages often lived amongst their victims the winter before.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup>All this has led to the Sylvanians becoming an insular people. They harbour resentments towards the Empire, especially Stirland. They avoid all contact with the outside world, and many know embarrassingly little about it. It is not uncommon for Sylvanians to not realise they are a part of the Empire, and many could not name the current Emperor if asked. Those who do know a little of the lands beyond their own know that they will not be accepted there, and Empire folk have as low of an opinion of Sylvanians as Sylvanians do of the Empire folk.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MXy22hFCgntdlQrn]{Animal Care}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq]{Charm}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.4IGdIhnwTaZijzg7]{Charm Animal}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Sylvania)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Undead)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Vampires)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.PzimjNx9Ojq4g6mV]{Melee (Polearm)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.os4NKy5Oy6sRt1eh]{Outdoor Survival}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Xk5tp3aasPNtk4zt]{Stealth (Rural)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.JLzJws09GMw9GWBV]{Coolheaded}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.oQzTJEXUx28sCiH3]{Sharp}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.jrFIFLhyOYwcyMUl]{Flee!}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"talabecland\">10. Talabecland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A thickly forested place, Talabecland has a reputation for barbarism and ignorance amongst the other Imperial Electoral Provinces. The folk of Talabecland ignore this nonsense, holding instead a private pride in their forestcraft and practical skills. At their best, Talabeclanders are patient woodsfolk, with a quiet intensity and honour. Reading, writing, and the scholastic arts are respected, but held in second place to the lore of the wilds.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>The men of Talabecland favour silence and deed over long speeches, but their womenfolk have a soft side for a honeyed word. As a consequence, rakish types, poets, and Reiklanders are viewed with firm suspicion throughout the province -- though in general Talabeclanders are more welcoming than their rural Stirlander cousins.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>The role of the father is considered especially important to the folk of the Great Woods. Even town-born men take their sons to the woods during the summer and teach them how to follow a trail, light a fire, and catch a meal. This is considered a matter of practicality, just like a Marienburger learning to swim. A lad without a father to patiently teach him the ways of the wood and the bow is considered unlucky.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Talabeclanders, even their nobility, are unusually self-effacing for an Imperial people. Their histories tell tales of great deeds while downplaying the role of the individual persons involved. &nbsp;At the tournaments held every two years at K&uuml;sel, Talabecland knights wear the provincial colours on their shields, the only indication of their families being a small badge on their shoulders.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Tradition considers the glory won to belong to the people of Talabecland as a whole.&nbsp;The Talabeclanders are also a religious people, revering all the gods of the Empire, but holding special reverence for Taal and Rhya. Indeed, Taal's greatest temple is found in the small woods outside Talabheim in the Great Crater.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Ulric is also popular, for although not braggarts, Talabeclanders are known for their warlike ways. Talabheim itself was the home of the Cult of Ulric for a while in the Second Millennium IC, when the Ar-Ulric left Middenheim for Talabheim after a dispute with the local elector count.</p>\n<p>At their worst, Talabeclanders can be argumentative, primitive, hard drinking, and just plain mean. And though they do not wear leaves, as outsiders sometimes accuse them of doing, Talabeclanders generally eschew elaborate clothes and prefer practical garb that can stand up to rough handling.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MXy22hFCgntdlQrn]{Animal Care}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.4IGdIhnwTaZijzg7]{Charm Animal}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Talabecland)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.zZUX7wO4rOo8k9F0]{Navigation}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.os4NKy5Oy6sRt1eh]{Outdoor Survival}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQSm2AwrgT2cHG0C]{Ranged (Bow)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rt2rGSwFDCDHPh0A]{Track}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:</strong>&nbsp;@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed} <em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.XIcDsaW4D8wScezw]{Accurate Shot}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.5lcttqGToT54WFrl]{Marksman}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.QsrXxGZiHjth7RMg]{Savvy}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"wissenland\">11.

They are a hardy people, given to few words and little emotion. Their stony implacability is known to soften when they are in their cups, and on rare occasions they might break into &ldquo;The Lament of Solland&rdquo; or other such lonesome ballad. At their best, Wissenlanders are stoic, dependable, and willing to endure hardship should it be needful. At their worst, they are depressing, dull, and obsessed with the gods.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>For all their earthy practicality, Wissenlanders are religiously devout, their towns and villages hosting multiple shrines, chapels, and temples to all the recognised gods, as well as local spirits. Many Wissenlanders take a few minutes each day to visit a temple or shrine, working their way through the gods over the course of a week. The people of Wissenland claim this is simple devotion on their part, while cynics elsewhere cannot decide if they are show-offs or trying to cover all the angles&mdash;or both.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>While all the gods are honoured in Wissenland, Sigmar and Taal and Rhya have special prominence.

{"_id":"QmSUiNGDtqxjnGf9","name":"Medals & Honors of the Empire","content":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Medals &amp; Honors of the Empire</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each Province of the Empire has its own, unique military traditions and structure, its own battlefield conditions and foes to fight. To reflect this, each Province has their own customs, ceremonies and awards for the men and women who serve the Empire from Soldiers and Cavalrymen, to Witch Hunters, or even Knights of particular skill, heroism, or stubborn tenacity. Man&rsquo;s allies are not exempt from these honors, as many a Dwarf, Elf, Halfling and even Ogre have received their fair share of accommodations and celebrations for their service. From the noblest of Elven Sorcerer or Dwarfen Engineer to the rowdiest of Tilean Mercenaries or Ogre Maneaters, the Empire has made sure to award its most faithful allies.</p>\n<p>Included below are those commendations unique to the Empire. These medals and honors are a tradition within the Empire&rsquo;s legacy dating back centuries and represent meritorious service against the main foes of the Mankind: The mutants that infest the forests and underbellies of all Empire towns and villages, the Orc hordes invading from the South in the Badlands, the Dark Elf corsairs and Norscan Marauders raiding from the Sea of Claws, those Chaos Warbands from the North that call the Chaos Wastes their home, and the Beastmen Warherds active in the Drakwald Forest. These are but a few of the innumerable threats that the Empire must face every day and have done so for over 2500 years.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are informal awards, marks of reputation rather than formal commendation, given by Imperial command. These honors are often recognized by a given Empire officer, knight or noble lord to acknowledge a warrior&rsquo;s skill and history fighting one of Mankind&rsquo;s many foes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>I - Kill Counts, War Trophies &amp; Titles</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3>Hunter</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Killer</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Reaper</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>II - Imperial Honors</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3>Artillerist's Honors</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Black Raven</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Bronze Stag</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Golden Eagle</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Iron Comet</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Magnus Cross</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Martyr's Medal</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Medal of Destiny</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Meteoric Medal</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Platinum Owl</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Pure Soul Medal</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Rat Slayer Commendation</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Sacred Fire Medal</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Silver Wolf</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>White Dove</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>I - Kill Counts, War Trophies &amp; Titles</h2>\n<p>For many warriors, each victory is accompanied by a simple ritual: a notch on a weapon or piece of armor, or a trophy from a fallen foe, a count for every enemy killed in service to the Empire. These simple counts add up over time, to eventually become a full-fledged part of the warrior&rsquo;s identity, fully incorporated in their heraldry and status. As a warrior moves through the ranks, their reputations as a fearsome fighter of a given enemy grows, eventually adding to their legendary reputation on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>These counts are collectively known as Kill Counts. Kill Counts are an informal honor, which means they hold no physical indication of accomplishments unlike medals, with the exception of trophies. Kill Counts in the form of trophies can be anything from a foe&rsquo;s weapon, armor, trinket or even their skull and other various body parts. Kill Counts are a part of the reputation of the warrior and are more a measure of their respect and status among knights, priests and soldiers, both within the Empire and among its enemies, than an adornment for a uniform.</p>\n<p>Kill Counts are a form of recognition for victory in battles, for causing damage and destruction to the goals and forces of a given adversary of the Empire. As such, Kill Counts are generally recognized after a certain number of successful battles or quests against a given foe. Optionally, the GM may wish to keep a running tally of every confirmed kill made by the warrior and have Kill Counts be a true count of the death toll the warrior has inflicted on the forces arrayed against the Empire of Mankind.</p>\n<p>Kill Counts are always applied to a particular enemy of the Empire. The types of Enemies represented by Kill Counts have to do with the creature, species or nation of the enemy type. Each of the major types of enemies and adversaries active within the Empire is an acceptable type of antagonist to be recognized by Kill Counts, which is normally a group of people or creatures, such as &lsquo;Rebels&rsquo;, &lsquo;Beastmen&rsquo;, &lsquo;Orcs&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Outlaws&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Everyone records their Kill Counts differently. Counts may be written down in journals, painted onto a shield, notched into weapons, represented with elaborate body scars or tattoos, or displayed as a myriad of trophies hanging from banners, mounts, or armor.</p>\n<p>Each type of Kill Count gives the warrior bonuses for fighting their adversaries, and additionally marks the warrior as an implacable foe of one of the Empire&rsquo;s many hated enemies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>1. Hunter</h3>\n<p>The warrior has become recognized and adept at rooting out a particular adversary of the Empire. Over the course of their adventures, the warrior has learned to recognize the telltale signs of one of the Empire&rsquo;s enemies and can recognize common battle tactics, tracks and other signs of their presence in the area.</p>\n<p>The warrior has likely developed a reputation throughout their current area as a skilled combatant against a given foe. They will often be given a nickname based off the foe they face: &ldquo;Orc Seeker,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gor Hunter,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bandit Catcher,&rdquo; for only a few examples. The GM and player are encouraged to come up with an appropriate appellation for any warrior that receives this status, based on their career and the specifics of their exploits.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> The warrior has been blooded against a particular enemy of the Empire, with a few successful encounters against that adversary under their belt. Optionally, the GM might wish to keep a full tally of the enemies they have killed. If this is the case, this Kill Count is awarded for 50 or more confirmed kills of a given enemy of the Empire by the character.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> You are well versed in discerning the movements, trails and patterns for the given enemy. You gain a <strong>+10 bonus to Perception and Psychology Tests</strong> related to the specific enemy on your travels (such as Tests to track them and Tests to avoid Surprise or Fear in combat).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Killer</h3>\n<p>The warrior has slain many of a given foe, and the locals in power have taken notice. Just as with other Kill Counts, the warrior is likely to have gained a reputation. The character is likely known throughout its current area with a nickname like &ldquo;Wrecker Killer&rdquo; or &ldquo;Zombie Butcher.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;The warrior has been an implacable foe of this enemy. Award this honor for successfully completing two or more adventures against a given adversary. Optionally, the GM can award the character this honor for 100 or more confirmed kills of a given enemy by the warrior.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> You have experienced first-hand the behaviors and tactics of your foe and can now begin to predict their behaviors and exploit their idiosyncrasies. You gain a <strong>+10 to any Intelligence Tests</strong> having to do with the chosen enemy, including and especially Lore Tests. Additionally, you are extremely adept at combating your specific enemy and gain a bonus of +1 SL on all combat Tests against the specified threat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Reaper</h3>\n<p>The warrior has developed a reputation throughout the Province, or even the Empire, as an expert fighter against a certain threat, and might be treated to such hushed sobriquets as &ldquo;Goblin Slayer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chaos Render,&rdquo; &ldquo;Morr&rsquo;s Right Hand,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sigmar&rsquo;s Justice.&rdquo; More likely than not, the character and their party has also developed a reputation with the enemy themselves, and might even be picked out for ambushes, targeted for assassination, or face other such reactive measures whenever their presence becomes known to their foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> The warrior has slaughtered scores of enemies of the Empire. Award this Kill Count for having successfully completed five or more adventures against a particular foe. Optionally, the GM can award this Kill Count if the character has decimated the enemy forces in numerous engagements, likely over the course of years or decades, and has earned 300 or more confirmed kills against this foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> You have faced this enemy in innumerable battles, and your combat prowess against this foe has become legendary. You know exactly how the enemy behaves, and how and where to hit that enemy when it is weakest. You inflict a bonus +1 Damage when attacking the chosen enemy and the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.8pVzgPkgWpTJvfhG]{Fearless (Enemy Type)} Talent is added to the Talent list of any career you are in.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the enemy has learned to fear you and the tales around you. You gain a +10 to Intimidation Tests and the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.pTorrE0l3VybAbtn]{Fear (1)} Trait against any enemy who is aware of your fearsome reputation. For every +100 additional confirmed kills of the specific enemy your @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.pTorrE0l3VybAbtn]{Fear} Rank increases by 1. If you have been particularly effective at routing, slaying and disrupting the plans of a specific faction within the many enemy races of Order (such as a Chaos cult, Skaven clan or a particular tribe of Greenskins or Beastmen), the GM might wish to give those enemies the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.5hH73j2NgPdsLCZN]{Hatred} Psychology against you to properly reflect their sworn vendettas and oaths of vengeance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>II - Imperial Honors</h2>\n<p>Imperial Honors are gallantry medals awarded by the lords and ladies within the various Provinces for service to the Empire &ldquo;fighting in the name of the emperor and Sigmar himself.&rdquo; Considering how much leaders often expect out of the average soldier or citizen, receipt of one of these honors is a rare moment, indeed. These medals are considered very important, and their titles are long-winded. For example, the full title of the Iron Comet would be, &ldquo;For Distinguished Service, Against the Enemies of Mankind and the God of the Empire, Iron Comet Medal.&rdquo; Imperial Honors are usually very large and ostentatious, though there is considerable variance in this regard. Receipt of these medals does not go unnoticed by the soldiery, priesthoods, knightly orders or nobility. Imperial Honors are always awarded for specific feats of bravery and skill; each one is often accompanied by a scar and a story. The average man or dwarf warrior will often ask the bearers to recount their tales of bygone battles, partly out of curiosity and a sense of camaraderie, but also in the hopes that they might pick up a few helpful pointers along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Medal Notes: </strong>Talents given by medals only apply to the initial receiver of the medal and non-Talent bonuses cannot be obtained by those who have not earned the medal themselves, however the medal must still be worn by the initial receiver. All medals can be identified with an<strong> Easy (+40) Skill Test</strong> using @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Empire)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Heraldry)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (History)}, or other similar Skills. Characters with Careers in the <em>Courtier </em>and <em>Warrior</em> Class may roll an <strong>Average (+20) Intelligence</strong> Test to know if they recognize any medal. Fake medals can be detected with an @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.bSWoV1IiS5qWNw39]{Evaluate} Test by anyone with the Numismatics Talent with the difficulty determined by the GM. The punishment of being caught using a fake medal is different within each Province but is often life imprisonment, forced service in the local army or militia, or simply death.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>1. Artillerist&rsquo;s Honors</h3>\n<p>The Artillerist&rsquo;s Honors is given to those heroes of the Empire who have decimated their way through enemy lines and into the true heart of invading armies from a distance with the expert use of artillery pieces&mdash;ballistae, cannons, etc. A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from the engineers, artillerists and soldiers of the Empire, as soldiers are the most affected by frontline warfare preferring to deal with as few combatants as possible, while engineers and artillery crews are quick to impress with well-placed, calculated shots and good use of their siege equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> A gold medallion with the image of a cannon etched on top.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong> 200 Confirmed kills using siege weapons and the destruction of a Chaos Dwarf, Ogre or Skaven engine of war.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> +10 to Lore Tests related to Armory, Construction, Engineering and Explosives, and the wearer gains a bonus of +10 to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.2Y91ebFapH6zRfHk]{Ranged (Engineering)} Tests when using siege equipment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Black Raven</h3>\n<p>The Black Raven is given to those heroes of the Empire who have vanquished massive amounts of Undead abominations and helped stem the tide of rotten flesh by destroying their vampire and necromancer masters.

Golden Eagle</h3>\n<p>The Golden Eagle is given to those heroes of the Empire who have displayed and proven their unmatched tactical and military knowledge on the battlefield. In the face of overwhelming opposition on all sides, the Empire cannot afford the same losses in war as their enemies from Greenkins to the Undead, who can replenish quickly.

A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from Myrmidians, military officers and high-ranking Imperial officials.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A gold medallion with a silver trim and the image of an eagle clutching a spear with its talons etched on top.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong>&nbsp;An extreme act of tactical or military brilliance on the battlefield that either allows for a major victory against a vastly superior foe (numbers, war gear, champions, etc.) with minimal to no losses or greatly turns the tide of battle from defeat to victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong>&nbsp;+10 to all @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore} Tests related to Warfare, and the wearer of this medal&rsquo;s melee attacks using a polearm gain the Precise Weapon Quality. If you do not have the Sharp Talent already, it will be added to the Talent list of any career you are in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Iron Comet</h3>\n<p>This Iron Comet is awarded for spearheading an act of Sigmar&rsquo;s will to end a threat to the Empire by cutting off the heads of their leaders&mdash;archenemies well known to the God of the Empire, predominantly servants of Chaos, Greenskins and Undead. These champions and warlords are heavily relied upon by their warbands, cults or clans, and their loss is a devastating blow to the enemy. A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from Sigmarites regardless of social status, from nobles and priests, to the common folk and peasants of the Empire devoted to Sigmar.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> An iron medallion with the image of the Twin Tailed Comet etched on top and a red gemstone inserted in its center.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong> Slaying a powerful and dangerous Daemon, Greenskin or Undead champion such as a Daemon Lord of Chaos, Greenskin Warboss, Master Necromancer or Vampire Lord in melee combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> The medal wearer&rsquo;s melee attacks against Daemons, Greenskins and Undead gain the Damaging Weapon Quality.

Magnus Cross</h3>\n<p>The Magnus Cross is the most famous and widely recognized medal in the Empire. It was first issued during the reign of Magnus the Pious under its original name as the &ldquo;Imperial Cross&rdquo; but has since been renamed in his honor since the great emperor&rsquo;s death. It was originally awarded to Magnus&rsquo; personal honor guard during the Great War Against Chaos and has been used ever since to reward those who would lay down their lives to protect the Empire&rsquo;s greatest leaders from the innumerable threats they face daily. A character with this medal can expect the highest amount of respect from the vast majority of Imperial citizens, nobles and military officials across the Empire, regardless of social status.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A black cross made of obsidian gemstone, with a gold trim and a golden skull wearing a civic crown in its center.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong>&nbsp;Preserving the Empire by protecting an Imperial figure of great importance from harm, such as an Elector Count or the Emperor (with their knowledge of your actions, of course).</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong>&nbsp;Whenever the wearer of this medal inflicts a Critical Hit against a Greenskin, Servant of Chaos or Undead, you may roll twice on the Critical Wounds Table and pick the higher result. Greenskins, Servants of Chaos and Undead may not ignore the Critical Wound under any circumstances (unless they successfully dodge it with an Opposed @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.1jCxbFAUuFuAPLJl]{Dodge} Test), including spending a Fate Point, using Critical Deflection or having the Impenetrable Armor Quality. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.vMYEkrWj0ip6ZOdv]{Resistance (Corruption)} Talent is added to the Talent list of any career you are in, and any bonus effects for Tests you gain from your Status are doubled with any Imperials who respect Status.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>7. Martyr&rsquo;s Medal</h3>\n<p>This medal is awarded to the grizzled and scarred veterans of the Empire, from the common swordsman to the militiamen and mercenaries that aid their local Provinces in their time of need, and payed the price for it. A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from the militia locals, mercenaries, soldiers and law enforcement of the Empire, retired or active in their duties.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> A bronze medallion with silver filigree and the image of a cracked skull etched on top.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong> An act of true bravery and sacrifice in the name of the Empire in the face of overwhelming odds and certain death to protect its people, so great it results in the loss of limbs or causes permanent mental scaring. Acts may include defending a village from an onslaught of Beastmen that overwhelm the defenders three to one, or a raid on an Orc encampment to break the back of a possible Orc invasion on a nearby town just to name a few examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> Whenever the wearer of this medal is required to make a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.meMkLEwdJIDLxM0B]{Terror} Test, they may spend a Fortune Point to automatically pass that Test with +Willpower Bonus SL and the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.8pVzgPkgWpTJvfhG]{Fearless (Any)} Talent is added to the Talent list of any career you are in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>8. Medal of Destiny</h3>\n<p>The Medal of Destiny is awarded is awarded for completing perilous deeds in the name of the Empire&rsquo;s most trusted and loyal subjects. Formed during the days of Magnus the Pious, the Medal of Destiny was created to reward only the most dedicated and loyal within the Empire&rsquo;s citizenry. Those who accept the near impossible tasks given are awarded with not only the medal and undying gratitude of the Province&rsquo;s officials, but a guaranteed promise of citizenship within the Empire and immediate elevation to noble status, the only medal of its kind to grant such. Due to its high value thanks to its promises of citizenship and noble status, it was decided that only the most carefully selected and tested noble officials within the Empire should be capable of awarding this medal to back up its legitimacy and avoid a complicated criminal element. These medals are forged by smiths from the Gold Order and as such are commonly tested by local Metal Wizards to be verified, in case a conman tries to act cheeky and flaunt their non-existent accomplishments and bogus status.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A gold medallion encrusted with gemstones in the colors of the local Province and the seal of a noble house etched on top.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong>&nbsp;Accomplishing perilous and borderline suicidal missions granted by an official of high esteem within the Empire, so dangerous you would have most likely needed divine aid to have survived.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong>&nbsp;The wearer of this medal gains 1 AP on the Body, and the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.u0CFf3xwiyidD9T5]{Luck} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1IVGksL10N7GVrw3]{Noble Blood} Talents are added to the Talent list of any career you are in. If the AP is Damaged, it takes until sunrise the following day for it to recover.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>9. Meteoric Medal</h3>\n<p>The Meteoric Medal is an ancient&mdash;possibly the oldest&mdash;honor ever given from Dwarf to Mankind since the foundation of the Empire. Only the greatest allies to the Dwarf Clans and their lords are even considered for this honor, which is less a medal and more a runic artifact crafted with the insignia of the clan who forges it. This honor proves to the Dwarfs one who is worthy of their respect, regardless of their beard length. No Dwarf would dare speak ill of anyone showing this medal in their presence and would sooner take the Slayer Oath than disrespect one who has aided the Dwarfs so honorably in these dark times.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> A gromril medallion carved into the head of Grungni, the Dwarf god of artistry, metalwork and mining, and emblazoned with a clan insignia and a glowing rune on the back side of the medal.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong> Preserving the ancient oath of friendship between Man and Dwarf, or proving yourself an ally to their cause through other means, by committing an act of great heroism in their name, such as: aiding them in discovering and reclaiming a long lost dwarf hold, returning ancient sacred Dwarfen artifacts, or crossing off the name of one of the Dwarf&rsquo;s greatest enemies from the Great Book of Grudges itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> The wearer of this medal gains a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.Bvd2aZ0gQUXHfCTh]{Ward (9+)} Creature Trait against all attacks and spells targeting you. Each hit successfully saved increases the Ward&rsquo;s effectiveness by 1, to a maximum of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.Bvd2aZ0gQUXHfCTh]{Ward (6+)}. The Ward resets back to 9+ at the end of an encounter or if the medal is removed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>10. Platinum Owl</h3>\n<p>The Platinum Owl is given to those heroes of the Empire who have dispatched justice so effectively within the Empire as to root out corruption and purge major internal struggles ripping apart the Empire from within. Be it in a court room, a dueling arena or through thorough investigation and espionage, those who expose and expunge the malign influences that threaten the political structure of the Empire are more than worthy of this medal. A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from Verena&rsquo;s followers and law officials like judges, lawyers, scholars, bailiffs, watchmen, road wardens and even some witch hunters.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A platinum medallion carved in the shape of an owl&rsquo;s head with a golden sword and scale in its center.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong>&nbsp;A wise act of justice that roots out and destroys the corruption eating away at the Empire by reporting, exposing and possibly executing a corrupt individual of great social and political status.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong>&nbsp;+10 to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore} Tests related to History, Law, Politics and Theology.

Pure Soul Medal</h3>\n<p>The Pure Soul Medal is given to the most pious and favored of the gods commonly worshipped within the Empire, from Patron Gods like Sigmar to the Classical Gods of the North and South from Ulric to Myrmidia. This medal is of such importance it is only awarded by Arch Lectors to the most righteous and dogmatic of religious fanatics within the Empire&mdash;not so fanatical as to be suicidal like the flagellants mind you, but equally as spirited and financially viable to their local temple. A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from the followers of their dominant religion and all priests and cultists, regardless of their faith, so long as their followers don&rsquo;t hold a rivalry or animosity towards one another, similar to Ulricians and Sigmarites.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> A gold medallion, inlaid with iron and the image of a hammer etched in, with a silver skull in the hammer&rsquo;s head.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong> An act of extreme piety, one that proves unmistakably you are a fervent and loyal follower of your deity in the eyes your god and their servants. Recovering long lost religious artifacts, successfully launching a crusade against enemies of a given deity or going on a years-long spiritual journey across the Old World, aiding as many temples as possible enough for word to reach the Arch Lectures of the various faiths.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> +10 to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.9xR9uO8FIvi4YsJp]{Pray} Tests and the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.wNvPXAhlKABl6hpk]{Pure Soul} Talent is added to the Talent list of any career you are in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>12. Rat Slayer Commendation</h3>\n<p>The Rat Slayer Commendation is unofficially known in private circles within the Imperial military and upper nobility as the &ldquo;Skaven Slayer Commendation.&rdquo; This medal is awarded to brave souls who risk their lives fighting the nefarious ratmen, without the luxuries of decent compensation or gratitude that benefit butchering better known threats to the Empire. This medal was created in honor of Mandred von Zelt, also known as Mandred Skavenslayer, one of the greatest Emperors in the Empire&rsquo;s history who pulled humanity out of the Black Death in the 12th Century IC, and a powerful champion of Ulric who devastated the Skaven in the ensuing wars against them. Most of the population will not recognize this emblem without prior knowledge of the Skaven, as is the intention of its design to keep attention towards it low. It will often be looked upon as a cheap, ugly piece of jewelry. However, within the right groups amongst the Imperial elite and revealing the heraldry of House Zelt on its back, many will acknowledge the medal wearer as a venerated champion of the Empire, but none will mention the word &ldquo;Skaven&rdquo; without caution.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> An iron medallion, inlaid with bronze with the image of a rat&rsquo;s head with two &lsquo;X&rsquo; marks over its eyes, and the heraldry of House Zelt emblazoned onto the back of the medal.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong> Slaying at least 200 Skaven and a powerful Skaven champion, such as a Grey Seer Lord, Master Assassin, Master Moulder, Warlock Chief Engineer or Warlord.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> The wearer of this medal&rsquo;s melee attacks against Rats and Skaven gain the Damaging Weapon Quality, and the wearer gains a bonus of +10 to all Psychology Tests related to Rats and Skaven. If the melee weapon already has Damaging it is replaced with the Impact Quality instead when striking Skaven.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>13. Sacred Fire Medal</h3>\n<p>The Sacred Fire Medal is awarded for eliminating a shadowy insurgent cell responsible for death, dissent and turmoil within the Empire. Things like secret Chaos cults, ambitious revolutionaries and hidden clans of nefarious ratmen are the fuel that keep the fires of Chaos expanding. Without these secretive, malevolent threats plaguing, killing and corrupting the people from within their communities, the growth of Chaos influence staggers or secedes.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A gold medallion encrusted with red gemstones and emblazoned with a red gem encrusted skull surrounded by flames.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong>&nbsp;Purging one of the Empire&rsquo;s large towns or cities by wiping out an entire underground network of its enemies, such as a Chaos Cult, Rebel Cell or a lesser Skaven Clan.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong>&nbsp;Wearers of this medal regain +1 Wound per hour and the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.xx8SgdWYEjKct7ym]{Implacable} Talent is added to the Talent list of any career you are in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>14. Silver Wolf</h3>\n<p>This Imperial Honor is awarded for spearheading an act of Ulric&rsquo;s will by challenging and cutting off the head of a powerful champion deemed worthy by the followers of the White Wolf. Archenemies well known to the temples of Ulric and Middenland consist of Beastmen, Greenskins and Mutants. These champions, warlords and cult leaders are heavily relied upon by their warbands, cults or clans, and their loss is a devastating blow to the enemy. A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from Ulricians regardless of social status, from nobles and priests, to the common folk and peasants of the Empire devoted to Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> A silver medallion carved in the shape of a wolf&rsquo;s head with its features etched in.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong> Slaying a powerful and dangerous Beastman, Greenskin or Mutant champion such as a Beastlord, Chaos Cult Leader, or Greenskin Warboss in melee combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> The medal wearer&rsquo;s melee attacks against Beastmen, Greenskins and Mutants, gain the Damaging Weapon Quality. Any warhammers or axes (the signature weapons of Ulric) you wield gain +1 Damage with this medal equipped. If you do not have either the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.zGQ0ShUTSlUvVtWh]{Warrior Born} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.RmY0CUjiFYZ3GEKY]{Very Resilient} Talent already, one may be added to the Talent list of any career you are in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>15. White Dove</h3>\n<p>The White Dove is given to those heroes of the Empire who have prioritized the preservation and safety of life over merely taking it in battle. It takes more than firepower and strategic planning to win wars, and nothing is more valuable in conflict than the health of the soldiers and citizens fighting in them every day. Be it through curing crippling wounds, plague or combat fatigue, those who spend their days saving the lives of the Empire&rsquo;s people are more than deserving of this medal. A character showing this medal can expect respect and appreciation from Shallya&rsquo;s followers and healers such as medics, physicians, jade wizards and apothecaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A silver medallion inlaid with white gemstone and the image of a dove etched in with a blood drop in its center.</p>\n<p><strong>Awarded For:</strong>&nbsp;Purity and altruism that saves the lives of at least 100 people through acts of physical, emotional or spiritual healing.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong>&nbsp;+10 to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.HXZaV1CJhmTvcAz4]{Heal} Tests and the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fEFAMNqh8nJIfBkM]{Field Dressing} Talent is added to the Talent list of any career you are in.

Some regiments have performed legendry feats on past battlefields that are forever commemorated by a symbolic change of uniform design or color. Other unorthodox formations adopt the style of a maverick leader or develop their own heritage over the course of long campaigning. Age-old enemies, unique fighting tactics, or even a chance to embellish their own mythic reputation have all been reason enough for regiments to adopt non-standard colors and symbols.</p>\n<p>At your third Career level, some provinces gain the option for you to enlist in a special Regiment based on your skill, performance or reputation on the battlefield, and possibly your Province of origin, providing you an additional Talent to purchase and a unique trapping upon enlistment.

In 1865 IC, they successfully defended the city of Carroburg, then under the control of Reikland, from the count of Middenland.

Those who dared to speak up against Vlad, let alone partake in armed resistance, soon disappeared, so in order to protect their identities, the first Death's Heads wore skulls as masks.</p>\n<p>The Death's Heads became famous after freeing Essen during a rebellion.

The patriarch of the noble family, Duke Bertold Von Kragsburg, also known as the \"Dirty Duke\", like his father before him, was forever seeking the glitter of gold in all its forms and value, seeking any avenue to ensure his wealth would grow ten-fold upon the climax of his endevour.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>As such, when the price is right the Von Kragsburg Guard have safeguarded merchants along the Old Dwarf Road for years, joined armies staving off invaders seeking to plunder Wissenland, and led expeditions to destroy Beastmen strongholds in the Great Forest region of Talabecland.

While the scruples of the \"Dirty Duke\" may be questioned, none may contest the regiments combat prowess. Countless tales prevail about their couragous actions on the battlefield, from withstanding charges from a horde of Goblin Wolf Riders on the plains of Averland to battling towering Ogres in the Worlds Edge Mountains, the proud Von Kragsburg Guard will always get the job, and always expect their employers to pay up.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Province:&nbsp;</strong>Averland</p>\n<p><strong>Trappings:&nbsp;</strong>Any Two Rare Items, 50 GC</p>\n<p><strong>Talent:&nbsp;</strong>You gain the @Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.talents-nom.1Y6Fu7uAsItBBYsl]{Dog of War} Talent</p>\n<p><strong>Uniform Colors:&nbsp;</strong>Yellow and Black</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"lNumE4kwYfzQkIkY":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ysz28jH2Y4Yt1Ogz"}}}

Albion</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Albion is a small, windswept island off the coast of Norsca in the Great Ocean. It is said that it rains every day in Albion, that the islands are shrouded in mist and heavy fog while the land is predominantly bogs, marshes and fens. This damp and gloomy environment is inhabited by tribes of woad-wearing humans, led by Truthsayers, guardians of the mysterious Ogham Stones, and inhabited by creatures such as Giants and the strange Fimirs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A Tilean explorer and conqueror,&nbsp; Curious Gesar, the so-called First Citizen of Remas, at one time reached the shores of the misty islands and tried to bring the native barbarians his view of Tilean culture. He was unsuccessful, instead taking Hengus the Druid and the two biggest Giants of Albion with him as hostages. Back in Tilea he was assassinated and the Giants roam now the Old World&nbsp;as mercenaries.<sup id=\"fn_3b_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>No truth to these stories has ever been proven, and the rumours of Albion remain little more than fantastic tales told by drunks to any who would listen. But then a new legend spread across the land. Sailors talked of an island which had suddenly appeared to the far north. Huge white cliffs loomed out from the sea but the sailors had also spied beaches where a small boat may possibly make a landing. It would seem that the mists had parted and the land lay open to explore. Every race across the world gathered its armies to seek the treasures of Albion and claim the island as their own.<sup id=\"fn_3b_back\"></sup></p>\n<p><strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.sRuMlaPU5xdIrwhd]{Climb}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.I0yPc4PH5erWJLmu]{Intimidate}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Albion)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Beasts or Monsters)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.PzimjNx9Ojq4g6mV]{Melee (Polearm)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.os4NKy5Oy6sRt1eh]{Outdoor Survival}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.NSnpJQiky8JcMnme]{Ranged (Throwing)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Xk5tp3aasPNtk4zt]{Stealth (Rural)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.vMYEkrWj0ip6ZOdv]{Resistance (Mutations)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.spdiWsONKTzkLbg3]{Stone Soup}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1dUizIgLBgn4jICC]{Strider (Marshes)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.zGQ0ShUTSlUvVtWh]{Warrior Born}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Zf0vk2rjllpDh0Ua]{Very Strong} <em>or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.RmY0CUjiFYZ3GEKY]{Very Resilient}</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2. Araby</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The kingdom of Araby encompasses the regions bordering the great desert north of the Southlands. It is a land of contrasts, where the people are both devout and godless. Exotic and extravagant cities where massive vaulted palaces, full of wealth beyond the imagination of the dwarfs, loom over adobe and stucco houses in winding streets. Its cheerful and bustling nights, street performers, music, alcohol, narcotics, fiery food and concubines make Araby a charming and irresistible place for many travelers. These islands of civilization are isolated by vast expanses of arid badlands and suffocating deserts. It is a land where few ideas are forbidden and where human sciences and philosophy rival even the elves of Ulthuan in sophistication. Sun-bleached ruins stand as reminders of the tumultuous past of Araby, but the invaders of old are the partners of today and almost all languages of the known world can be heard in the streets of its ports and bazaars.</p>\n<p>Even united under the distant rule of the Great Sultan, the people of Araby are a disparate lot. The coastal Arabyans live in relatively fertile lands and have built some of the most wonderous cities of the world. They are educated, often multilingual and open to foreign cultures. The Arabyans of the hinterlands are hardier folks, used to surviving in the desert where almost no water or shade can be found and heat is pervasive. They are a mystical and harsh people, shaped by their home desert and daily struggles for survival.</p>\n<p>However, the apparent prosperity of the land conceals many problems. Often enough, a sorcerer oversteps one of the few taboos and delves into the forbidden arts. Nomad bandits scour the desert, and are but the least of many threats a traveler may encounter across the expanses of Araby. Ancient curses slumber in the ruins that dot the landscape while undead remnants of past wars still wander the desert or wait patiently beneath unsuspecting cities. The mysterious ratmen are still rumored to monitor the evolution of Araby from their lairs in the mountains, and secret cults to blasphemous deities lurk in the deepest valleys and ruins.&nbsp;<strong>- Kingdom of the Shifting Sands</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.fdq3RFSOKl5b3WzW]{Art ( Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.bSWoV1IiS5qWNw39]{Evaluate}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Indan or Southlander)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.X16IoUlKcVLI4MRw]{Language (Wastelander)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (City State)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.zZUX7wO4rOo8k9F0]{Navigation}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.9xR9uO8FIvi4YsJp]{Pray}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MeXCAQ3wqJzX07X7]{Ride (Camel or Horse)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.n8IfmLt4kzMhIKIv]{Sail (Xebec or Dhow or Felucca)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.7bZjB82f6LSkeczP]{Nimble Fingered}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GRRN3XAKIpEVCY7z]{Craftsman (Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.vMYEkrWj0ip6ZOdv]{Resistance (Heat)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1dUizIgLBgn4jICC]{Strider (Deserts)}, <strong>City State Trait (Any)</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>City State Traits :</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Copher: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.34EBUkHQkrqF1sq7]{Briber}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.epPBu7x6BRWp2PHG]{Dealmaker}, One @Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>El-Kalabad: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.wBhPFggGqIXwbx1r]{Alley Cat}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.9sMAf0xmehjEmUao]{Fast Hands}, One @Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Lashiek: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Ij9N3G8jzxb4lrwy]{Sea Legs}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.qZ4cFy6z482ZONuA]{Sturdy}, One @Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Martek: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GRRN3XAKIpEVCY7z]{Craftsman (Mining)}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Z91GFaT6FhEwyESU]{Tunnel Rat}, One&nbsp;@Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Sudenberg: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.726gbrANZt8OqXr5]{Linguistics}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.5QcrpLQWWrsbKR79]{Numismatics}, One&nbsp;@Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Antoch: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.5lcttqGToT54WFrl]{Marksman}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.zGQ0ShUTSlUvVtWh]{Warrior Born}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.GwjvDLZz3PvK6xgs]{Prejudice (Bretonnians}</li>\n<li><strong>Sartosa: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.r180vP86SlwyJc8W]{Criminal}, One @Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Nomad: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.spdiWsONKTzkLbg3]{Stone Soup}, One @Table[talents]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>3.

The Knights of Bretonnia are trained to fight from childhood, and even the lowliest knights errant are considered superior to ordinary warriors. Their skills are further enhanced through constant training, battles and tournaments. It is not only Bretonnia's knights who are famed, however, for the kingdom also boasts the finest human sailors in the World. With their great sails billowing in the wind, Bretonnia's mighty fleets are&nbsp;a majestic sight on the high seas. Due to this regime, the combined military might of Bretonnia has surpassed that of even the greatest armies in history.</p>\n<p>Bretonnia is widely considered to be the fairest and most beautiful land in all the Old World. It is a green land of fertile farms, rolling hills, starkly beautiful mountains, and airy forests. Bretonnian chefs are famous for their culinary skills, and the wine produced in the vineyards of the country is renowned throughout the world. It is seen as a land of honour and virtue, where noble knights keep the domain safe as peasants till the fields, where chivalrous heroes slay monsters and rescue fair damsels.

The lure of the Silk Road is great to the merchant houses of Tilea and the Burgomeisters of the Empire, as well as the traders of Araby. But the road is far from safe: roving bandits, steppe nomads, and the vast Hobgoblin hordes of Hobgobla-Khan who rule the steppes are an ever-present threat, and one that cannot be taken too lightly. Only one caravan out of ten makes the trip safely.</p>\n<p>The travellers that return from Cathay tell tales of great golden pagodas and the inexhaustible armies of the eastern despots. They bring exotic spices and finest silks, gleaming gold, luxurious porcelain vases and all manner of strange and wonderful items from the Kingdom of the Dragon, glimpses of the mysterious glory of the distant and rich orient.</p>\n<p>They also bring tales of jade cities and high temples where mystics probe the movements of the heavenly bodies and the positions of the stars, of the scholars who inscribe every word ever uttered by their divine Emperor. Many strange creatures are said to live in the land of Cathay, from serpentine dragons to gigantic living stone dogs which guard the temples of the multitudinous gods of Cathay.</p>\n<p>Records of travellers tell of the thousand, thousand footsoldiers of the Emperor, the mystic brotherhoods of monks who can kill you with a touch of their hand, and the strange monkey warriors living high in the Mountains of Heaven.</p>\n<p>Most of these tales are highly fanciful, but certainly the Empire of the Celestial Dragon must be a wondrous and rich place, but until the trade routes to the east are safe it will remain a realm of legend.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.fdq3RFSOKl5b3WzW]{Art ( Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq]{Charm}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.sRuMlaPU5xdIrwhd]{Climb}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (indan)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Nipponese)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.X16IoUlKcVLI4MRw]{Language (Wastelander)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Province)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQSm2AwrgT2cHG0C]{Ranged (Bow)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.JLzJws09GMw9GWBV]{Coolheaded}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.QsrXxGZiHjth7RMg]{Savvy}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.726gbrANZt8OqXr5]{Linguistics}, <strong>Provincial Trait (Any)</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Provincial Traits :</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weijin: </strong>Three @Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Nan-Gau:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GRRN3XAKIpEVCY7z]{Craftsman (Engineering)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.zGQ0ShUTSlUvVtWh]{Warrior Born}, Two&nbsp;@Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Fu-Chow:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1kgHcImgfyKI1IYp]{Fisherman}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Ij9N3G8jzxb4lrwy]{Sea Legs}, One&nbsp;@Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Shang-Yang:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}, Two&nbsp;@Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Xianbei: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.E98mVLZgE8bX5vQW]{Hatred (Skavens)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.zGQ0ShUTSlUvVtWh]{Warrior Born}, One @Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Yuanjin: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.JLzJws09GMw9GWBV]{Coolheaded}, Two @Table[talents]</li>\n<li><strong>Han Kuo:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.RmY0CUjiFYZ3GEKY]{Very Resilient}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Zf0vk2rjllpDh0Ua]{Very Strong}, Two @Table[talents]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>5.

In fact, doing something as simple as crossing a bridge the wrong way, or eating meat can stir up the ire of the locals in some places, bringing down swift retribution upon the confused traveller. The gods of Ind are also a puzzling lot, and travellers are advised to smile politely and nod, as a local offers up prayers to his mouse or weevil deity, all the while content in the knowledge that Sigmar could crush them had he half a mind.<sup id=\"fn_13a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Many are the tales of wonder told by spice merchants returned from the lands to the east of the Old World, but few such yarns can be as bizarre as the accounts of the creatures said to reside in the verdant rainforests of central Ind.

Westerland (Wasteland)</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Wasteland is a coastal area around the mouth of the River Reik which contains the prosperous city of Marienburg. The Wasteland used to be the Empire province of Westerland that was conquered in 501 IC by Emperor Sigismund II, until it seceded during the reign of Emperor Dieter IV in 2429 IC through a hefty bribe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Marienburg is considered to be the largest trading hub in the Old World and is the greatest of its ports, far more wondrous than even the city-states of Tilea. Straddling the mouth of the River Reik as it drains the mainland into the Sea of Claws, nearly all maritime trade that concerns Bretonnia and the Empire happens here. It is a place of great wealth and great opportunity. It is a place despised by the Empire, despite its reliance on the fabulous port city&rsquo;s good fortunes.<sup id=\"fn_2a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Marienburg is vast; a bright spot in an otherwise forlorn and wretched landscape. The people of the city are descended by the tribe of the Jutones, who drove the Endals and the Fimir off their lands and made the marshes their new found home. In fact, the people of Westerland are of Endal stock while the city itself is purely Jutones in origin. The city itself rises from the foetid swamp that typifies the Wasteland, that gloomy march between the impenetrable Drakwald Forest and the immense Pale Sisters. With the regular rains, sucking mires, and the strange breed of peasants that make their living trawling the dark waters of the countryside, reaching the grand city can sometimes be a feat in and of itself. A visitor to Marienburg can quickly be overwhelmed by the sheer size of this metropolis, with its innumerable islands, canals, and labyrinthine streets. So large is the city that many of its denizens rarely venture beyond their own districts, and can only speculate about what happens on the other side of the city.<sup id=\"fn_2b_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Anyone wishing to get anywhere in the city must cough up a few coins to pay for passage on one of the canals. Certainly, one could get where they want to go on foot, but the streets are so narrow, so twisting, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost, swallowed whole by a city that always hungers for fresh meat. Thus the canals are the main thoroughfares and the murky waters, glistening with the oily sheen of filth, are filled with skiffs, rowboats, sailing ships, and even galleons come to pass through the city and venture onwards to Altdorf or even as far as Nuln.&nbsp;<strong>-Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.d3VZwO4Y5JH5DXdT]{Bribery}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq]{Charm}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.bSWoV1IiS5qWNw39]{Evaluate}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Arabyan)}&nbsp;<em>or</em> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.5EvSIh1khpt77uM7]{Language (Bretonnian)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Cathayan)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Nipponese)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Emd8lVdIpaXTxLwL]{Language (Estalian)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.12e3H6NX4JH0bwI3]{Language (Tilean)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Westerland)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.n8IfmLt4kzMhIKIv]{Sail (Cog or Caravel or Carrack or Frigate or Barge)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.wKwel9MG7NIG3i3w]{Trade (Any)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.34EBUkHQkrqF1sq7]{Briber}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.epPBu7x6BRWp2PHG]{Dealmaker}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.QsrXxGZiHjth7RMg]{Savvy}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}, Three @Table[talents]</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"lNumE4kwYfzQkIkY":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ttaRocfnRUtFZHKK"}}}

Knights are magnificent figures, clad in gleaming Full Plate Armor crafted by Dwarfen smiths, armed with weaponry of the finest quality. To become a Knight is also to become one of the most elite warriors the Empire has to offer.</p>\n<p>Because the cost of individual knightly training is prohibitively expensive, many sons of the Imperial nobility choose to join one of the many brotherhoods located throughout the Empire to progress through society, and as such, the Knightly Orders come in many different shape and sizes. Some of these Orders, like the Knights Griffon, only recruit from the local nobility, while others become templars of a particular Imperial deity, such as the zealous Knights of Sigmar's Blood or the Knights of the White Wolf. Some are well known throughout the Empire, while others are quite small, relatively unknown sects valiantly doing their part to make the Empire a safer place for Men to live.</p>\n<p>Although the common people might find little distinction between the many Knight Orders of the Empire, upon closer observation, one will realize that there are two distinct types of Knightly Orders within the Empire itself. These types are divided between the common Secular Orders (An Order of Knights with no specific allegiance to a Ruler or Religion), and a Templar Order (An Order founded for the purpose of servitude to a particular god).&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>These bonuses are granted to those who select the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.n2VdkCPNNxdupjeQ]{Knight} Career in the WFRP 4E Core Book and dedicate themselves to a specific order of knights.

{"_id":"osHXViEGAvRC1j0N","name":"Dogs of War Rules","content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Dogs of War, also known as the Regiments of Renown, is a polite catch-all term to generally describe Mercenaries from all across the known World, fighting on behalf of anyone willing to pay their exorbitant prices. They are drawn to places where fortunes can be won by ruthless adventures. From the lush jungles of the West to the misty isles of the East, and from the steamy swamplands of the South to the harsh snowlands of the north, the world is truly awash with rag-tag armies of sellswords who nurture the wishful dreams of loot, plunder and adventure. Although many Dogs of War ply their bloody trade to every point on the compass, the most notorious breeding-ground of mercenaries lies within the fraction war-torn city-states of Tilea in the Old World. From all the kingdoms of the Old World and many more beyond, sell-swords come towards Tilea in the tens of thousands, reassured of profitable employment and great battles to be won. Tilea is the battleground from which these gold-hungry mercenaries will ply their expertise to all those willing to pay. Yet no matter the motivation, bold armies of Dogs of War depart every few weeks from the ports of Tilea and sail off into the sunset, ready to conqueror new lands and found new Kingdoms the likes of which no man have ever seen before.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cost:</strong> Each Mercenary Company charges its own rates, some straight forward and others are bizarre and unique. These Cost rates are flat and pay for exactly one mercenary’s day of service. A full week of service is 3x the listed Cost for the mercenary, however they will not ask for a portion of any loot acquired. Time is money, and these elite mercenaries have no time for simple quick jobs and scuffles, they’re above that. If you wish to hire an entire Unit of mercenaries, the Cost will be multiplied by 10x, however they will not share any additional Traits purchased. To make controlling a Unit easier, add the Swarm Creature Trait to the Unit for the purposes of combat. Optional Traits may be purchased for a single mercenary and increase the GC Cost of the mercenary by 50% of their base price per Trait and an increase in their share of the loot by a percentage equal to their Initial Fellowship Bonus prior to any Traits added. Only one mercenary may have the Leader Trait.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Availability:</strong> Availability is relative to the Empire and requires a d100 roll by the GM to see if they may be hired within the territory the PCs occupy. If the PCs wish to hire a company from outside of their territory, they must write a letter with half of the required payment to the designated mercenary company and wait. Their request will take 30 + d10 Days until the PC receives an answer, meanwhile it will take 30 – Fellowship Bonus Days for the mercenary, or mercenaries, to arrive should they accept any contract with the PC. The Availability of these mercenaries is increased by 2x when in the lands of Araby, Estalia, Marienburg, The Border Princes or Tilea.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.L8nQJZCKQaoHKwUB]{Empire Veteran Mercenaries}</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>4 GC + 5d10 Silver Shillings, 15% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> 30% Chance (Does not increase outside The Empire)</p>\n<p><strong>Nation of Origin: </strong>The Empire</p>\n<p><strong>Motto: </strong>None</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"> </p>\n<p>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.nhMl7rZa6FC2hROg]{Al Muktar's Desert Dogs}</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>5 GC + 2d10 Silver Shilling, 15% Portion of Loot or Jewelry</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> 10% Chance</p>\n<p><strong>Nation of Origin:</strong> Araby</p>\n<p><strong>Motto: </strong><em>“Mighty are the Muktarhin!”</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.aHpqe27UlWkEAIoy]{Bearmen of Urslo}</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5 GC + d10 Silver Shillings, +1 Corruption Point, 20% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> 10% Chance</p>\n<p><strong>Nation of Origin:</strong> Norsca</p>\n<p><strong>Motto: </strong><em>“The Dark Gods bless us!”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.endg7rsLSFu7q0Nk]{Birdmen of Catrazza}</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cost:</strong> 6 GC + 5d10 Silver Shillings, 20% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Availability:</strong> 5% Chance</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nation of Origin: </strong>Verezzo, Tilean City-State</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Motto: </strong><em>“Those magnificent men in their flying machines.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.oT7OHqnd6Tx8ANpS]{Braganza's Besiegers}</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cost:</strong> 6 GC + 5d10 Silver Shillings, 20% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Availability: </strong>10% Chance</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nation of Origin: </strong>Miragliano, Tilean City-State</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Motto:</strong> <em>“Invincibility at no extra charge.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.o6LWVETFeTXRCXpq]{Bronzino's Galloper Guns}</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cost:</strong> 5 GC + 5d10 Silver Shillings, Gun Parts,15% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Availability:</strong> 5% Chance</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nation of Origin:</strong> Remas, Tilean City-State</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Motto:</strong> “<em>The biggest bang for your bucks!”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.X3Elbf3yFrnJ8KYP]{Golgfag's Maneaters}</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cost: </strong>9 GC, Massive Feast, 25% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Availability:</strong> 5% Chance</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nation of Origin: </strong>The Ogre Kingdoms</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Motto: </strong><em>“You’ve hired da rest, now try da best!”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.rAkzbCWWrrQxy29t]{Leopold's Leopard Company}</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>6 GC + 5d10 Silver Shillings, 20% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p><strong>Availability: </strong>10% Chance</p>\n<p><strong>Nation of Origin:</strong> Luccini, Tilean City-State</p>\n<p><strong>Motto</strong>: <em>“Proceeds to the Luccini Temple’s restoration fund.”</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.RoSVafNpjI99AVth]{Long Drong's Slayer Pirates}</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>4 GC + 4d10 Brass Pennies, Several Kegs of Ale, 10% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p><strong>Availability: </strong>10% Chance</p>\n<p><strong>Nation of Origin:</strong> Sartosa, Tilean Pirate Republic</p>\n<p><strong>Motto:</strong> <em>“Lost pay chest recovery is our specialty.”</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[nations-of-mankind-wfrp4e.bestiary-nom.kejBhhssYr7t0mRk]{Lumpin Croop’s Fighting Cocks}</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 GC + d10 Silver, Meats &amp; Veggies, 15% Portion of Loot</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> 20% Chance</p>\n<p><strong>Nation of Origin:</strong> The Moot, Empire Province</p>\n<p><strong>Motto:</strong> <em>“Expert marksman, trackers and woodsmen.

Averland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The people of Averland are curious folk. Folk whisper the proud bloodline of the Brigundians has somewhat curdled with time, inbreeding, and the looming influence of the Black Mountains. At their best, Averlanders are open, passionate, and honest about just what they're thinking. If a funeral happens to strike them as funny, well, they'll laugh. If someone upsets them, they'll let you know. Known to be generous, especially when entertaining, Averlanders prize those skilled at the art of telling tall stories, something wandering entertainers are very glad of. Dwarfs are also very welcomed in Averland as their plain talking ways are much admired.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>At their worst Averlanders are contradictory, flighty, and changeable. Astrology and other such superstitions are very popular in Averland, and merchants will often ditch a deal made in \"an unfavoruable hour\" or on an \"unlucky day.\" Marius Leitdorf, known for his dark depression and strange rages, was considered typical of the Averland temperment. Even Trollslayers have been heard to say that Averlanders are \"a bit odd in the head.\" Their changeable nature has resulted in many jokes about regiments of Averlanders retreating in the face of fear, something that irritates them to no end. They resent any implication that their martial prowess is any less than that of any other states. Averlanders are also known for their intolerance of lawyers and contracts, as they imply a man might change his mind. Those dealing with Averlanders are constantly irritated with their insistence that everything be done \"on honour\" - particularly given their unreliable reputation. Some whisper this \"whim of iron\" is in fact a cunning bargaining tool of the Averland merchants.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Averlanders have a strange, almost \"sing-song\" element to their speech. They tend to soften harsh words and elongate vowels. Many artists and young nobles with pretensions to poetry imitate an Averlander accent, in a belief that all great geniuses are touched by madness.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup> &nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MXy22hFCgntdlQrn]{Animal Care}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.4IGdIhnwTaZijzg7]{Charm Animal}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.0CwV96kTDRF0jUhk]{Entertain (Speeches)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.5EvSIh1khpt77uM7]{Language (Bretonnian)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XzPlUWFDtOOjG98P]{Language (Khazalid)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Cg2b92BRjvxYXZiE]{Language (Mootish)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Averland)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oSbEE6eXH1S3LfUU]{Ride (Horse)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.wKwel9MG7NIG3i3w]{Trade (Farmer)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.E98mVLZgE8bX5vQW]{Hatred (Greenskins}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Dwarfs}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>One @Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"hochland\">2. Hochland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hochland is a small but proud province, famed for its hunters and trackers. The Hochlanders' traditional dish of fired venison has been exported across the Empire, but gourmands say it still tastes best cooked under the night sky of Hochland. At their best, Hochlanders are loyal, valiant, and adaptable. <sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Present-day Hochlanders are amongst the most open minded and friendly people in the Empire. With their lands being a crossroad for so much of the northern and eastern Empire, they have developed tolerance that is considered unusual everywhere else in the realm.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Though mainly worshippers of Taal, Rhya, and of Sigmar, contact with travellers and merchants using the roads has made Ulric popular in the northeast, while Shallya also has a strong cult. Contact with educated outsiders has led to a respect for intellectuals, so much so that the rulers of Hergig encouraged the founding of a private academy and even a small school of wizardry.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Recognising their lands are unsuited to large-scale farming or cattle-raising, the people of Hochland have done what they can to encourage others to visit and leave some of their money behind. Shrines to several cults can be found in most towns and villages, each claiming to be the site of a miracle and having blessed relics for sale.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Fortified coaching inns sprang up along the roads for the convenience of travelers, though several had been bought by the rival Tunnelway and Wolf Runners coaching company. Fond of hunting in all its form, tales of loyal friendship and jaunty ballads, Hochlanders are also known to be easily distracted by the prospect of little sport.Some folk of other Imperial provinces also whisper that the Hochlanders' valiant nature is due more to their naivety than any innate loyalty.

Middenland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like all Northerners, Middenlanders are famed for their stubborn ways. This, their Teutogen blood and their &ldquo;firebrand&rdquo; tempers has given them a reputation as uncontrollable traditionalists. They hate change of all types, and defend what they see as &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; at all cost. They are the last to admit that they are wrong, and the first to challenge an unworthy leader. Whilst those of southern Middenland are less strident than their Drakwald cousins, even they are considered coarse, arrogant, and controlling by the rest of the Empire. At their best, Middenlanders are staunch defenders of pride, property and traditions. Should an unjust tax be levied, Middenlanders will march in protest, torches flaming and pitchforks raised. They can sometimes rally behind a single person&rsquo;s case, particularly those of destitute war widows, orphans and put upon guild members.</p>\n<p>This has caused Middenland politics to have a crude, rabble-rousing element that does not exist so much in other provinces. At their worst, Middenlanders are a fractious, intolerant group of individuals. Not only are they quick to mock those they see as foppish, dandified folk, they are also exceedingly suspicious of foreign influence upon their province. They refuse to use the occasional Bretonnian, Tilean, or Estalian words that have been absorbed into Reikspiel. Ordering a Bretonnian brandy in a Middenland Tavern will cause a yawning silence as all the folk look round at the fool who has just signed his own death warrant.</p>\n<p>Middenlanders are divided along what were once boundaries of ancient Teutogen Clans, but have now been divided into geographical prejudices. At one time the Drakwald region had a distinct identity from the rest of Middenland, producing a line of notoriously corrupt Emperors. With the collapse of their dynasty and the devastation of the Great Plague of 1111, the power of the Drakwald was decimated. It ceased to exist as a separate entity when the Emperor Mandred gave it to Middenheim, creating the province as it stands today. Its people are still known as mean-spirited and grasping but seem to be softening over time and incorporated into the Middenlander people.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rules for creating a Middenlander or a Middenheimer character are described page 151 &amp; 152 of the official Supplement <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"nordland\">4. Nordland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The people of Nordland are descendents of the ancient <em>Was Jutone</em> tribe. Close brothers to the Udoses and Was Jutones tribe of Ostland, the Nordland branch of the tribe eventually became estranged from the more easterly settlements of their peoples. Eventually the early Nordlanders fell in battle, becoming vassals of the belligerent Teutogens, and frequent victims of Norscan raids. During the chaos that reigned in the aftermath of the Great Plague, much of Nordland's coast was invaded and colonised by the Norscans, leading to a mingling of the tribal bloodlines. Emperor Mandred Ratslayer, faced with graver threats elsewhere, had little time to answer the pleas of the Nordlanders, much to their horror.</p>\n<p>As time passed and populations mixed, the Nordlanders adopted many of the customs of their Norscan cousins. Courts frequently resort to trial of combat, the contest taking place on a white sheet pegged to the ground. The first person to stain the sheet red with his blood is declared the loser and the guilty party. Older houses often have runes carved into their doors and window frames for luck and spiritual protection, and along the coast the longhouse style is still common. At feasts and gatherings, Norscan bragging contests have evolved into more genteel storytelling events, with each speaker trying to outdo the last.</p>\n<p>So great is the Nordlanders love of stories that they have become famous around the Empire as great storytellers. The folk of this province are said to be amongst the loudest and frankest of all the empire. They seem to lack any subtlety, tact, or common sense. Several local legends involve heroes who blurt out the truth at the vital moments, thus saving the day. Other provinces point out this is because Nordlanders are too stupid to lie. At their best Nordlanders are solid, straightforward, and honest folk, looking down upon (while lacking the guile of) the mealy mouthed words of politicians, poets, and soft Reiklanders.</p>\n<p>At their worst, Nordlanders are churlish, uncouth, thoughtless speakers. Even the merchants of Nordland have this blunt approach, though they seem to be fine with double-dealings. Indeed they have found that shouting the final price has a profound effect upon merchants used to the subtleties of barter and negotiation. Many provinces point out that this is because of their mongrel <em>Was Jutone</em>, <em>Teutogen</em>, and <em>Norscan </em>Bloodlines. This mixed of heritage has been a source of Nordlander shame for many generations. Modern Imperials look on Norscans with a mixture of admiration and fear, seeing them both as powerful warriors and wild, uncivilized barbarians, not to be trusted around one's daughters or sheep. A popular Imperial saying runs \"<em>Character is in the blood</em>\", meaning the ancestry determines character.</p>\n<p>Thus the Nordlanders are often regarded as \"Not quite like us\" rougher and more uncouth even more so than the wild and hairy Middenlanders. Another case of discomfort among Nordlanders comes form their current fashion among nobles especially in the north, for tracing ancestry back to one of the founding tribes. The purer the background the higher ones status climbs, and the summit is the tracing of a lineage back to one of the founding chiefs. Alone amongst the provinces, the Nordlanders ancestors were conquered by outsiders, which is a source of embarrassment for status-conscious nobles, particularly when dealing with arrogant Middenlanders and Stirlander bumkpins.</p>\n<p>To compensate, most Nordlanders are more vocally and demonstratively loyal to the Empire and the Cult of Ulric than almost anyone else in the empire. Their efforts ring hollow to some, while others see them as examples of duty and patriotism. Whatever the motive, there is no doubting their bravery in battle. When in an army with troops from other provinces, Nordlanders are rash in their desire to close with the enemy. At the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Battle of Frote (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQmF0dGxlX29mX0Zyb3RlP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\">Battle of Frote</a> in 2421 IC, the Nordland pikes were so anxious to come to grips with the forces of Chaos that they charged before an order was given, leaving them isolated on the battlefield and their own army's flank exposed. Since then imperial generals have been quietly advised to treat the Nordlanders \"as they would a hound on a leash\" - to keep them under control.</p>\n<p>Renowned hunters and foresters, the Nordlanders woodland skills are so strong that even Hochlanders and the folk of the Talabec will grudgingly admit that they are \"not too bad\". Certainly Nordlanders are close to the land: the province has one of the largest communites of Rhya worship in the North of the Empire centred around the clannish villages south of Hargendorf. The Worship of the Harvest Mother without her consort Taal, is considered particularly dangerous in some circles of thought. Talabeclanders in particular are dismissive of this \"women worship\". They whisper that the Elves join the Humans for their religious rites at old stone circles deep in the woods, though speculation is rife, so no-one knows what really goes on in these ceremonies. The Elector Count is not comfortable with this, and is considering sending investigators to determine if the people of the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Demst Vale (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRGVtc3RfVmFsZT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Demst Vale</a> are planning a revolt. A Nordlander's accent is one of the most distinctive of the Empire. Their speech is very harsh and fast, almost barked out rather then spoken.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rules for creating a Nordlander character are described page 153 of the official Supplement <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"ostermark\">5. Ostermark</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ostermarkers tend to be stout and thickset, and their eyes often reveal an Eastern heritage brought by the Ungols long ago. Their men are given to wearing long, thick moustaches rather than beards, and a high-peaked fur hat replaces the more fashionable floppy headgear found elsewhere in the Empire. Women wear their hair loose if single, or in a long braid wound up at the back of the head if married. Because of the cold weather, Ostermarkers tend to wear several layers of clothing in a style that seems quaint or old-fashioned to others in the Empire.&nbsp;At their best, Ostermarkers are vibrant souls, with a love of life, horses, vodka, and dancing. Their women in particular are known for their quick tempers and passionate nature. More than one Reiklander dandy has been dumped semi-naked on the Veldt after attempting to seduce a maid of Ostermark &mdash; often by the maid herself.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Few Empire folk naturally think of this side of the Ostermark nature, however. Most claim that Ostermarkers are half Kislevite, half peasant and entirely morose. Famed for long drinking binges, elaborate funerals, and combinations of the two, many people fear to ask an Ostermarker how their day has been, for fear of a depressing monologue.&nbsp;At their worst Ostermarkers show an almost theatrical obsession with death and its trappings. Women seldom remarry once widowed, for no Ostermark husband would stay in Morr&rsquo;s realm knowing another man was with his wife.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Fear of hauntings makes exorcists and priests of Morr very welcome throughout Ostermark, whilst carpenters are very much in demand to carve the elaborate coffins that are so common in this province. To an Ostermarker, this tradition of flamboyant despair is natural. Coming from a province that is regularly raided, destroyed, and plundered, they understand that death is a common part of life.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup>&nbsp; <strong>- Warhammer Forum</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.R2ytluHiEFF2KQ5e]{Consume Alcohol}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.I0yPc4PH5erWJLmu]{Intimidate}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.cYtU0ORRFCOpQLWz]{Intuition}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.EXysjCwmGzCOiRDx]{Language (Gospodarinyi)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Ungol)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Ostermark)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.PzimjNx9Ojq4g6mV]{Melee (Polearm)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQSm2AwrgT2cHG0C]{Ranged (Bow)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>One&nbsp;@Table[talents], @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.5lcttqGToT54WFrl]{Marksman}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.JLzJws09GMw9GWBV]{Coolheaded}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"ostland\">6.

Said to be capable of eating anything, there are several mocking songs about the famous &lsquo;Stone soup of Ostland&rsquo; They are so creative in their frugality that a common joke in the Empire claims that Ostlanders make &lsquo;stone soup&rsquo; with only one stone, for fear of wasting good rocks. While an exaggeration, it is true that Ostlanders are skilled in getting the most use out of what they have to work with and for being loath to throw anything away that might still be useful. This conservatism has at times cost them, as when <a class=\"new\" title=\"Von Raukov (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVm9uX1JhdWtvdj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">von Raukov&rsquo;s</a> predecessors refused to adopt gunpowder weapons, because that would mean wasting perfectly good swords and spears.

They hate waste of all sorts, as well as &ldquo;needless ostentation.&rdquo; A strong streak of jealousy against the so-called &ldquo;breadbasket&rdquo; provinces of Reikland, Stirland, Averland, and the Moot rises up in drunken rages. More than ever, stout soldiers are toasting old glories with Kislev Vodka, sinking into drunken stupors or violent rampages. Short shrift is also given to those who complain of hardship.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Ostlanders, like most Imperials, honour all the gods and celebrate their feast days. If one god is favoured over another, however, it is Sigmar, who is worshipped with a degree of devotion not often seen north of the Empire. Surrounded by lands that lean toward Ulric, Taal and Rhya, few know why this is so, though many offer explanations. Devout Ostlanders say it stems from the time when, soon after the founding of the Empire, a great dragon ravaged Ostland. The other electors and their armies were afraid to face the beast, so Sigmar came alone and killed it after a great fight alongside the Ostland Count.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, cynics suggest that Ostlanders are so devoted because their &ldquo;poor cousin&rdquo; Electors have to keep borrowing money from wealthy Reiklanders and thus need to keep them happy. Whatever the truth, it is a fact that even the smallest Ostlander village sports multiple shrines to Sigmar. Ostlanders are known for the strange pacing and Kislevite tones of their speech.

Reikland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Reiklanders are the descendants of the fierce Unberogens, a warrior tribe of the northern Old World which saw the lands unified under their king Sigmar during the founding years of the Empire. At their best, Reiklanders are friendly, sociable, and open-minded, more so than the rest of the Empire.</p>\n<p>Reiklanders are optimists who believe that the best is yet to come. They point out several reasons for this: the natural bounty of their lands, an educated and energetic populace, and the fact that Sigmar was one of them. How could the future be dim for a land and people that once gave birth to a god? Reiklanders have adopted Sigmar's message of Imperial unity wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p>Reiklanders take a keen interest in the affairs of the other Imperial provinces, and often point out that \"something should be done\" when terrible fates befall their neighbours. Robust supporters of the Imperial military, many young Reikland nobles enter the army to make their name and fortune. Considered natural \"officer material\" the chances of advancement are considerably better for those of Reiklander birth, much to others' disapproval.</p>\n<p>Reiklanders almost always answer an Imperial call-to-arms in large numbers, and feel as if its their duty to come to the aid of less fortunate parts of the Empire. Indeed, among some Reiklanders the ideal of expansion is as strong as it was in the early days of the Empire: Agitators in Ubersreik and Altdorf press for war with Bretonnia to reclaim the \"West March.\"</p>\n<p>Merchants' guilds desire to see the Emperor strengthen his position against the Elector Counts, and thereby call for unitary trade laws, which would be overseen by Imperial officials, something the Electors fiercely resist, determined to see no further centralisation of Imperial political power.</p>\n<p>Fashion plays a more important role in a Reiklander's social life than in most other provinces. The peasantry, of course, care little for such fripperies, but amongst the growing middle classes the correct sleeves, shoes, and colours are matters of great import. The Reiklander nobility tend to set the fashion for a season, leaving it to the merchant and other \"grubby tradesmen\" to copy their new styles as fast as they can.</p>\n<p>The presence of the Imperial Court in Altdorf has only served to exacerbate these tendencies. Recent vogues have included Bretonnian styles, the \"new rustic,\" and most recently a return to simple militaristic clothing reminiscent of an earlier era. Slashed sleeves, elaborate codpieces, and reliquary charms remain as fashionable as ever.</p>\n<p>At their worst, Reiklanders are arrogant, overbearing, and drunken slaves to fashion. Notorious for their ability to celebrate at the drop of a hat, the image of the beribboned Reiklander sot is a popular stereotype amongst the rest of the Empire. In certain places the small black insects that plague an ill-kept taproom are known as \"Reikflies\" as they can detect the smallest amount of ale unerringly.</p>\n<p>The people of many of the other Imperial provinces are suspicious of the fashionable, cosmopolitan nature of the Reikland men, claiming that they are effeminate and womanish for caring so much about what they wear. Curiously, Reiklander men also have a reputation as wife-stealing, pig-buggering philanderers.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>More than one Talabeclander husband has found his woman seduced by the charming words and dashing look of a Reiklander dandy. Reiklander women, meanwhile, are known for their beauty, as well as unbearably vain personality.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Loud, outspoken, and often smug about the imagined superiority of their opinions, Reiklanders are traditionally known to be controlling and strongly opinionated.

Stirland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For their part, the folk of Stirland are proud of their preservation of ancient customs, and of their &ldquo;long view&rdquo; of life. At their best, Stirlanders are calm, thoughtful, and practised at taking their time about things. Fond of long, ribald tales, the local tavern is the heart of any Stirlander community. Here people gather to hear their favourite stories, the local gossip, and occasionally news from the outside world. Racing is also a firm favourite of the Stirland people&mdash;though not the traditional foot or horseback racing liked by the rest of the Empire.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>As most communities are based about arable farmlands, geese, cows, pigs, and ratting dogs are frequently raced against one another in local competitions. Usually held on a festival or market day, the winning beast is often awarded &ldquo;ribbons and reprieve,&rdquo; meaning it will never be destined for the table. At their worst, Stirlanders are isolationist, suspicious, and highly conservative. Stirlanders, however, see themselves as simply keeping traditions: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve worked in the past, so no sense in changing now,&rdquo; as Stirlanders like to say. They find it hard to make friends&mdash;often taking years to accept newcomers within their communities. Most of the Empire regards them as savages, simply for their custom of drinking hot ale.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>There are many other odd customs; for example, when strangers approach a village in the Stirh&uuml;gels, children will throw pig droppings at them in the belief that this will drive away evil spirits. They believe that a person hit with tossed pig excrement is especially protected. In the villages near Sylvania, houses and windows are lined with an especially pungent strain of local garlic to ward of what are euphemistically called &ldquo;the Count&rsquo;s Men.&rdquo; When someone vanishes, locals swear that the fault lies with old garlic, not that the folk belief itself is wrong. Stirlanders within the central territories of the province are known for their dislike of Halflings, for they still resent the 1500-year-old decision that tore away their best farmlands and gave them to &ldquo;the Shorties.&rdquo; Although this resentment rarely breaks out in violence, the belief that Halflings are thieves at heart is stronger here than in any other part of the Empire.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Forum</strong><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.d3VZwO4Y5JH5DXdT]{Bribery}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.bSWoV1IiS5qWNw39]{Evaluate}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Cg2b92BRjvxYXZiE]{Language (Mootish)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Stirland)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQSm2AwrgT2cHG0C]{Ranged (Bow)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rvd0S8Z0v2m0MHmD]{Sleight of Hand}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Xk5tp3aasPNtk4zt]{Stealth (Rural)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.zkI6tIqbyAZvh0Th]{Stealth (Urban)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>One&nbsp;@Table[talents], @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.7bZjB82f6LSkeczP]{Nimble Fingered}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"sylvania\">9. Sylvania</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sylvanians often have a blas&eacute; attitude towards death and the dead that is at odds with their neighbours. They take a perverse pride in the harshness of their life, seeing others as &ldquo;soft&rdquo; for living in warmer climes, using blackpowder weapons, or associating with the other races. Sylvanians believe in the worst stereotypes, and it is common to find they believe Dwarfs drown cats, and Halflings routinely eat each other. This attitude goes all the way back to the Fennones of old, who refused to deal with the Dwarfs they encountered in the foothills of the Worlds Edge Mountains because they ignorantly believed that they came from the same place as the marauding Greenskins who raided their land.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>The largest towns of Sylvania are still considered rural backwaters by the standards of cultured Empire folk, half-empty places where everybody wears codpieces that haven't been fashionable for over fifty years. These towns support only a few burghers, as few can afford their bills, and most are merely overgrown villages that happen to be built on better land. Since Sylvania&rsquo;s population never truly recovered from the Black Plague and the contagions that followed, overcrowding had never been a problem.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>In addition to disease, mutation is rife amongst the peasants. The thin soil has been riddled with Warpstone since 1111 IC, giving Sylvania one of the highest rates of mutation in the Empire. The most deformed Mutants are cast out into the woods or sent to Drakenhof, but many who would be burned elsewhere are accepted in Sylvania. Hunchbacks, walleyes, and those with additional digits are treated no differently from others.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>With the low yield of crops, starvation is a constant threat, and most accept hunger pains as a normal part of life. Turning to &ldquo;sweet pork&rdquo;, the Sylvanians&rsquo; euphemism for Human flesh, is considered distasteful but not evil. Desperate times can call for desperate measures, and the Ghouls that raid the villages often lived amongst their victims the winter before.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup>All this has led to the Sylvanians becoming an insular people. They harbour resentments towards the Empire, especially Stirland. They avoid all contact with the outside world, and many know embarrassingly little about it. It is not uncommon for Sylvanians to not realise they are a part of the Empire, and many could not name the current Emperor if asked. Those who do know a little of the lands beyond their own know that they will not be accepted there, and Empire folk have as low of an opinion of Sylvanians as Sylvanians do of the Empire folk.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MXy22hFCgntdlQrn]{Animal Care}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq]{Charm}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.4IGdIhnwTaZijzg7]{Charm Animal}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Sylvania)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Undead)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Vampires)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.PzimjNx9Ojq4g6mV]{Melee (Polearm)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.os4NKy5Oy6sRt1eh]{Outdoor Survival}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Xk5tp3aasPNtk4zt]{Stealth (Rural)}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.JLzJws09GMw9GWBV]{Coolheaded}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.oQzTJEXUx28sCiH3]{Sharp}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.jrFIFLhyOYwcyMUl]{Flee!}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"talabecland\">10. Talabecland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A thickly forested place, Talabecland has a reputation for barbarism and ignorance amongst the other Imperial Electoral Provinces. The folk of Talabecland ignore this nonsense, holding instead a private pride in their forestcraft and practical skills. At their best, Talabeclanders are patient woodsfolk, with a quiet intensity and honour. Reading, writing, and the scholastic arts are respected, but held in second place to the lore of the wilds.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>The men of Talabecland favour silence and deed over long speeches, but their womenfolk have a soft side for a honeyed word. As a consequence, rakish types, poets, and Reiklanders are viewed with firm suspicion throughout the province -- though in general Talabeclanders are more welcoming than their rural Stirlander cousins.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>The role of the father is considered especially important to the folk of the Great Woods. Even town-born men take their sons to the woods during the summer and teach them how to follow a trail, light a fire, and catch a meal. This is considered a matter of practicality, just like a Marienburger learning to swim. A lad without a father to patiently teach him the ways of the wood and the bow is considered unlucky.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Talabeclanders, even their nobility, are unusually self-effacing for an Imperial people. Their histories tell tales of great deeds while downplaying the role of the individual persons involved. &nbsp;At the tournaments held every two years at K&uuml;sel, Talabecland knights wear the provincial colours on their shields, the only indication of their families being a small badge on their shoulders.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Tradition considers the glory won to belong to the people of Talabecland as a whole.&nbsp;The Talabeclanders are also a religious people, revering all the gods of the Empire, but holding special reverence for Taal and Rhya. Indeed, Taal's greatest temple is found in the small woods outside Talabheim in the Great Crater.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>Ulric is also popular, for although not braggarts, Talabeclanders are known for their warlike ways. Talabheim itself was the home of the Cult of Ulric for a while in the Second Millennium IC, when the Ar-Ulric left Middenheim for Talabheim after a dispute with the local elector count.</p>\n<p>At their worst, Talabeclanders can be argumentative, primitive, hard drinking, and just plain mean. And though they do not wear leaves, as outsiders sometimes accuse them of doing, Talabeclanders generally eschew elaborate clothes and prefer practical garb that can stand up to rough handling.&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong><sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MXy22hFCgntdlQrn]{Animal Care}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.4IGdIhnwTaZijzg7]{Charm Animal}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pKLMbmG3Ivt6mzMf]{Haggle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Talabecland)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.zZUX7wO4rOo8k9F0]{Navigation}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.os4NKy5Oy6sRt1eh]{Outdoor Survival}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQSm2AwrgT2cHG0C]{Ranged (Bow)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.rt2rGSwFDCDHPh0A]{Track}</p>\n<p><strong>Talents:</strong>&nbsp;@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed} <em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.XIcDsaW4D8wScezw]{Accurate Shot}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.5lcttqGToT54WFrl]{Marksman}&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.QsrXxGZiHjth7RMg]{Savvy}, Three&nbsp;@Table[talents]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"wissenland\">11. Wissenland</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The folk of Wissenland are known to be a dour lot. The fall of Solland was a dark chapter in Imperial history, and Wissenlanders seem to carry this shame with them. They are a hardy people, given to few words and little emotion. Their stony implacability is known to soften when they are in their cups, and on rare occasions they might break into &ldquo;The Lament of Solland&rdquo; or other such lonesome ballad. At their best, Wissenlanders are stoic, dependable, and willing to endure hardship should it be needful. At their worst, they are depressing, dull, and obsessed with the gods.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>For all their earthy practicality, Wissenlanders are religiously devout, their towns and villages hosting multiple shrines, chapels, and temples to all the recognised gods, as well as local spirits. Many Wissenlanders take a few minutes each day to visit a temple or shrine, working their way through the gods over the course of a week. The people of Wissenland claim this is simple devotion on their part, while cynics elsewhere cannot decide if they are show-offs or trying to cover all the angles&mdash;or both.<sup id=\"fn_1a_back\"></sup></p>\n<p>While all the gods are honoured in Wissenland, Sigmar and Taal and Rhya have special prominence. Sigmar&rsquo;s cult centres in the west, where contact with the Dwarfs is greatest. Both Wissenburg and Meissen have large temples that host shrines for the Dwarfs to worship their own deities, whilst upriver from <a class=\"new\" title=\"Geschburg (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvR2VzY2hidXJnP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\">Geschburg</a> in the foothills of the Grey Mountains lies the shrine of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Sigmar Protector (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvU2lnbWFyX1Byb3RlY3Rvcj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Sigmar Protector</a>, a popular pilgrimage spot.
